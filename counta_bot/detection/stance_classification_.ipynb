       "{'arg': These people are definitely victims but in my opinion referring to them as survivors is in many cases overly dramatic. They might be referred to as survivors if their lives legitimately came into jeopardy if they were held at gunpoint if they were severely physically assaulted etc. but most instances of rape unwanted sexual advances isolated to a single instance do not come attached with a serious possibility of death. Rape is definitely one of the worst things that can happen to somebody but I think that survivor suggests that what happened to them was on the same level as living through a genocidal campaign a terminal illness a plane crash or something else of the sort. The former is bad but the latter are almost certainly worse. Rape victims calling themselves survivors takes attention away from more serious issues in which death is on the line. Again rape is a very serious issue but not as serious as issues that consistently result in death.,\n",

People arise from nature. Humankinds capacity to create problemsolve analyze rationalize and build also come from natural processes. How are the things we create unnatural? It is only through natural occurrences that we have this ability why is it that we would give the credit of these things solely to man as opposed to nature? We are not separate from nature thus how can any of our actions or creations be unnatural? If we were somehow separate from nature I would understand the distinction between natural and manmade. However I think unnatural and manmade are not synonyms by any means. It seems to me that manmade things MUST be natural due to our being part of nature.

I think this regardless of whether the weapons used by the attackers were owned legally makes a good case for promoting a culture of a reasonable gun ownership and carrying. Say if out of people carried a gun with them was well trained in its use and tested in his responsibility to prevent its misuse and society upheld the value of these people as protectors it would benefit the society more the the current state of legislature and culture of gun ownership in most of European countries.

Those time periodsplaces did not enjoy lower rates of violent death. Consider the wild west. Obviously it wasnt nearly as full of gun battles as the movies make it seem but according this study the murder rate was extraordinarily high by todays standard. Looking at the rest of the thread I think I see what might be a flaw in our collective logic. The incidents that stand out most in our heads are events like Paris or Aurora or Columbine premeditated shootings with the intent of inflicting a lot of casualties. If the staff at Charlie Hebdo or Columbine High had guns they certainly might have been able to end these incidents earlier. They also might have inflicted more casualties with stray bullets. These types of hypothetical calculations arent really helpful in my opinion.But lets assume that more guns makes mass shootings less likely. Would this actually make a more heavily armed society a more polite one?I dont think it would because though premeditated murders could well be less likely accidental deaths unplanned homicides and suicides would like increase. This study found that owning a gun makes one more likely to die from suicide and homicide. Of course thats correlation so there might be some third factor at play that makes gun owners more likely to b targets of crime or clinically depressed but it certainly suggests that owning a gun doesnt automatically make you safer. Whether or not more guns would prevent events like todays isnt the issue though I am inclined to say they wouldnt necessarily do that it seems like a greater proliferation of weapons would be more dangerous for a number of other reasons.'},\n",

Itll be easier to change my mind in other words about view than view Im not certain that its a worthwhile endeavor.Let me start off by saying that I understand the issues with victim blaming. Theres an unfortunate tendency that Ive noticed particularly on the Internet but occasionally in person as well to blame the victims of terrible situations. Were seeing it with responses to the police murders of black citizens people trying to find a reason why the person was shot and we see it with victims of rape people say you shouldnt have been so drunk or you shouldnt have been in that area of town. There are all sorts of possible explanations as to why victim blaming occurs one of the most convincing to me is that these occurrences cause a sort of cognitive dissonance in our minds where bad things happen to people who dont deserve it. We like to think of our world as just in some way so we come up with reasons why these people Deserved what they got. People rarely go so far as to say a woman deserved to be raped but theres a certain amount of otherization and lack of empathy that goes on a sense that well that wouldnt have happened to me because I wouldve been more careful. Additionally it blames the victim for something that you should be blaming the perpetrator for. And thats all bad.On the other hand it remains the case that the world is not a just place. Yes we can work towards justice we can work towards eliminating racism overt or structural and we can work towards a society in which women feel safer. And we absolutely should. In the meantime however it is important to understand lines of causation. Im not going with a very complicated definition of causation here basically a model in which two events or situations occur A and B and one event B would not have occurred the other A had not occurred. A caused B. Im aware there are logical or philosophical arguments against this model but thats not the view Im trying to have changed if you can make a compelling argument about the relevant views using those points go ahead.The case I often think of concerns myself and friends of mine. I live in a large city. It is safe for the most part but there are certain areas that you shouldnt walk in at night because you might get mugged. Both myself and a friend of mine have been mugged while walking through these areas. The causation is if we hadnt been walking through those areas we wouldnt have gotten mugged. So we dont walk through those areas at night anymore. Its still possible that well get mugged elsewhere but in my mind weve decreased our chances which is a good thing. We didnt deserve to get mugged before but changing our behavior prevented us from getting mugged again.Thus explaining causation is not justification. Its simply understanding the chain of events that led to another event.Finally my second view is that its a worthwhile endeavor. As I said we avoid those dangerous areas at night now and I feel weve decreased our chances of getting mugged. We understood the causation behind a negative situation and we changed our behavior accordingly. Ideally all areas would be safe to walk in but theyre not so we dont walk in the unsafe areas anymore. Yes this has mildly restricted our behavior but its worth it to us so that we dont get mugged. I understood these are hairy issues and maybe theres a fine line between causation and justification. .As far as part of my view goes I still stand by my original statement. Granted people have pointed out inconsistencies in the term causation but as I said Im not really trying to have a discussion about causation as a concept. I understand that its very complex and of course many factors go into a certain outcome. I am well aware of probabilistic models of eventsoutcomes my point was never to say that avoid certain areas means you wont get mugged or something like that. It concerned a marginal decrease of risk a change in probability. Furthermore the point itself was actually that explaining causation is not victim blaming and this view has not been addressed sufficiently. Ive changed my view to the point that I dont think explaining causation is always the appropriate response particularly in traumatic cases like sexual assault. I do still think its often important to explain causation before the fact as some users have suggested as an alternative simply to give people a good idea of what precautions they might want to take. Most specifically no one has really addressed this notion of causation vs. justification. One person has said theyre the same thing but not really offered an explanation for that.

       "  'counters': 'I would say that the difficulty here is in assigning causal factors accurately. Lets take your example Actually it would have also prevented your being mugged had you left minutes later. It further likely would have prevented your mugging had one of you been armed. If the muggers spouse had a fight with them before they left the house to mug you and this delayed them so you passed before they did it would have prevented your mugging. Your being mugged is a statistical outcome not attributable to any one behavior on your part. In this case the root cause is exactly and only the mugger choosing to mug you. Theres no other causal factor that would have actually prevented the situation only changed the probabilities and you cant really trust probabilities to guide specific behavior in specific situations. Absolute causation isnt a helpful concept in cases like this. The causal factors of one individual trial of a statistical experiment arent very important. The response to a statistical problem is not to change behavior on individual trials of the experiment its to address the root cause of the statistical problem. We cant nor should we do everything in our power to reduce all possibility of danger. Surely you can see the reductio ad absurdum here. We have to weigh the effectiveness of our strategies against the costs and benefits. If avoiding one part of town reduces your risk by lets convert everything to dollars here for ease of calculation . but it costs you . in inconvenience exercise of your rights enjoyment of life and every other factor most of which are very hard to calculate then you should not avoid that part of town even if it led to your being mugged.Its not necessarily wrong to point out these statistical factors in order to help people make returnoninvestment calculations if thats your real goal. Its not too helpful because people dont really have enough information nor training in statistical theory to apply that information. But its really very hard to come up with true valuations of these factors. Dont make the mistake of thinking that because its obvious to you that a part of town is dangerous that it is worthwhile to tell someone they should avoid that part of town. If you want to tell people in general that traveling in that part of town has a . chance of resulting in their being mugged and robbed of their pocket change lets say the average is with another in lost peace of mind by all means let them know that the expected cost of that behavior is . so that they can decide if its worth that cost to them.And thats about accurate for the most dangerous parts of any town and for actual losses typically incurred. If you exaggerate the danger youre not doing anyone any favors and are actually doing them harm statistically.When you talk to an actual victim about these things realize that they already probably have a vastly inflated opinion about the risks of their behavior because they have suffered an unlikely outcome in that regard. Almost in every case if youre speaking to a victim it would be more accurate to downplay the risks that they took if your goal is to actually statistically help them. If someone is in a plane crash and is injured your telling them that riding planes is dangerous is true as far as it goes... its just a lot less dangerous than driving which is what theyre likely to do instead. Societally speaking we have to be very careful what we warn people about because everyones mileage varies.'},\n",

       "  'counters': 'I think youre correct for the most part but still believe I can change your view a bit due to adding an emotional component you may not be considering due to inexperience with some situations. I want to note I dont think this inexperience makes you a bad person or an idiot its just data you may not have to put into consideration. While speaking about causation can be beneficial in a vacuum there is an overall context that may make it harmful and when and how you discuss it can lead to it being potentially more damaging than helpful.When I entered my friends room after they called me about being assaulted I found them sobbing and repeating to themself Im so stupid. They had invited someone they didnt know very well into their room something just about everyone Ive known has done multiple times and in this case it turned out for the worst.If someone had come in and said to my friend well inviting someone into your room is a risky thing to do then I wouldnt be frustrated with that person because they were wrong I would be frustrated with them because they were being emotionally inconsiderate. Yes there were logical decisions on my friends part that put them at risk but my friend is already dealing with emotionally damaging selfblaming and selfloathing and this just throws fuel on the fire. When someone is unable to leave a room for weeks because of waking up in the middle of the night sobbing and having flashbacks you pointing out how they could have lessened their chance of this occurring is not on the top of the list of things that need to be addressed. Later when that person is speaking with a trusted therapist who can unwind causality from selfblame is a more appropriate context to discuss the the issue with that person.Id equate it to walking up to someone whose dog was hit by a car and saying dogchains will keep the dog away from the street and make it less likely to be hit by a car. Youre not logically wrong but youre not really helping. By pointing out the causality to the owner who is likely already blaming themself youre likely hurting them more than your information is worth. In addition youre not fully informed for all you know the owners last dog strangled itself on its chain and he just put in a fence that the new dog dug under. This is why there are commenters in this thread who are saying people are being unempathetic theyre not seeing the emotional context of the event and just focusing on the logical context considering the causality in a vacuum instead of as part of a whole incident. Again this is not because theyre stupid but because they likely have never had a full context on an issue like this before.This is not to say that conversations shouldnt be had about dangerous areas or that people shouldnt be warned about dangerous activities those things lead to betterinformed citizens and better policing as well as other endeavors such as improved lighting for areas that are highcrime. However there needs to be a question of when and with whom that conversation should be had in cases like sexual assualt I think the causation argument should be had with the therapist. People who see it on the news and say it especially without the full context are potentially doing more damage to the person than they are helping without realizing it.'},\n",

Theres always talk of Big Questions and Deep Problems or whatnot and I think that misses the point. Philosophy is a set of methods and concepts that you learn and practice and wield and those methods and concepts are extremely useful in all sorts of circumstances.What you really learn or rather the most practically valuable thing you learn is to become an expert in analytical thinking. That means things like identifying hidden assumptions in peoples reasoning noticing informal and formal logical fallacies and generating counterexamples identifying and isolating distinct concepts that people have mistakenly superimposed assessing things like the knowability or provability of a claim identifying and avoiding circular reasoning formulating alternative possible explanations when data underdetermines the given theory and on and on. The problem with thoughtful introspection is that youre vulnerable to your own bias. Its very difficult to poke holes in your own reasoning because you always think youre right. Studying philosophy is an opportunity to practice poking holes in arguments that can be very nuanced and very airtight you dont get this so much in stnd year courses and then have a trained philosopher read and poke holes in your reasoning too. You get to read arguments against other arguments and see how expert thinkers think.Obviously not you need to study science though you would be surprised how many leading scientists actively study philosophy. Science is a set of methods and concepts that helps you explore the relationships between things in the world. Philosophy on the other hand is a set of methods and concepts that helps you explore reasoning. You call on science when you need to answer questions about how the world works and you call on philosophers when you need to know about how to reason correctly in unfamiliar conceptual territory.Most people dont need philosophy to tell them what to do on a daytoday basis because most people dont encounter important and unfamiliar moral choices on a daytoday basis. But Hospitals hire philosophers Bioethicists to help them decide on policies and decisions that affect peoples lives in novel and controversial ways e.g. stem cells abortion the policies for people in vegetative states etc.. Likewise most peoples lives are sufficiently common and boring that thoughtful introspection will do them just fine but for example cutting edge businesses e.g. tech or service startups rely on previously untested reasoning and it can be very useful to have a capable trained set of eyes on your thought process before you pull the trigger.TLDR Philosophy is like the science of reasoning and it can be very useful when you have to reason in unfamiliar or novel ways such as new business ideas medical practices and even science'},\n",

Intelligence is hard to define and describe even by neurologists and reducing that complexity down to one number is incredibly challenging if not impossible. It may also be important to note that your system isnt only difficult to implement like you point out its also in direct conflict with how things actually work. More intelligent people tend to have less children than do the more uneducated. There are multiple reasons for this more intelligent people tend to be more busy with careers etc. Lastly you must recognize that the IQ test is a standardized test. This means that even if we went really extreme and killed everyone with an IQ under .....that would change nothing.

Yes.So what if instead of killing off the lessintelligent people Im against killing. Of most things. we just limit offspring?For example we could use the IQ scale for want of a better intelligence measure to determine the number of offspring a person should be able to genetically contribute to.Like round the IQ to the nearest multiple of then divide by and thats the number of offspring youre allowed to create.So someone with near average intelligence near IQ would have their IQ rounded to and then divided by to make offspring. The total offspring is presumably equal to the number of people who contributed to it. A man and a woman with average IQ can have two children not each. and sustain their population.Conversely really above average IQs of can contribute genetically towards children... and so on.This would eventually make the human race smarter and therefore more likely to survive and advance the human race. I know this would be a bitch to implement and its near impossible to actually do but Im just looking at the concept. I know the IQ test has its faults and every policy can be abused... I know all that.Exceptions would be made when you accidentally have twins which causes you to go over your limit or etc. If a mother can make and has twins she cant make more but if she already has one and has twins after one which makes were not gonna kill onePerhaps if you have a major heritable health issue your IQ has subtracted from it before being rounded?

I think is flawed for a few reasons. Firstly many mothers who had abortions decided to have children later in their life. But if they had not aborted their earlier pregnancies then many of them would not have made that decision. Secondly had those abortions never occurred then Americas immigration policies would not have been so lax as there would be less need for unskilled labor leading to less unskilled immigrants in exchange for more unskilled natives all of whom would be taxpaying citizens unlike all immigrants.

However Purchasing meat from farms known to produce their meat in an ethical way not only denies demand to large factory farms but helps improve the market share of ethical meatgrowing which seems as though it would be even better for animal welfare.My general view is that people should probably as a rule eat less meat from better growers and that will make for a bigger shift in growing practices than simply people dropping out of eating meat altogether. Moreover this practice would be much easier to evangelize than a vegetarian or vegan diet. Face it meat is tasty and nonfactory meat is often tastier than factoryfarmed meat at least in my own anecdotal experience',\n",

However I strongly strongly doubt they believe that in doing so they are making great strides in improving conditions for animals. I think you are misinterpreting their motives. I dont believe in donating to the Salvation Army for example because there have been incidents in the past where their organization has denied aid to homosexuals and publicly expressed homophobic views. However I do NOT believe that my actions will bring about the demise of the Salvation Army or really have any effect at all. That is not my motive. That would just be delusional. I think the vast majority of vegans and vegetarians are not delusional and feel similarly about the meat industry as I do about the Salvation Army.'},\n",

I understand why politics use this slogan because they are trying to get americans to vote for them but this slogan is also prominent in ads made by private corporations. As if creating jobs for americans is morally superior to creating jobs for people of other countries. The companies launching these ads may be trying to win in the american market so they can sell more of their product but the fact that this can increase sales shows that many americans hold the being born on one side of a line belief. I am not blaming the politicians or corporations running ads running these slogans they are merely trying to win votes or make money from this mentality but really it is the citizens that have the belief that they are better because of the side of a line they are born on that are at fault.

Nationalism is the one that says America is the best most perfect country in the world unlike those other horrible dirty evil foreign countries. Americans are the shining example of civil people in the world and everyone else is filthy and brutish and doesnt deserve entry here. Patriotism simply says America is a good country. its not the best and it might be better or worse than other countries but i still love and respect it.they do not have a belief that they are better. they have the belief that they are American and would prefer their country over other countries regardless of whos betternot morally superior but makes more sense. even if countries are peaceful and cooperative towards each other they are still in competition and no matter what they are still separate and independent. and in a competition you dont provide for the opposite side. It is simply not our place or responsibility to carry other countries burdens. And these slogans dont even denote any sense of superiority over a foreign country just a preference for your own country. if an advertisement was creating jobs for Americans and not for those dirty foreign leeches THAT would be claiming superiority over foreigners.

Id say more it just lets people be free free to test the waters and do whatever without your ideas jokes concepts tied to any identity. Every thought stands of its own individual merits.Ive been around chan since and the only way I would ever describe it would be chaotic neutral. One day groups from or within it might organize some raid for the lolz another day theyre saving a kitten finding the girl who threw a puppy in a river saving a girl from bullying and suicide paying some poor dudes rent organizing against the harmful practices of a cult bringing more exposure to a rape victimgive some random vet the best birthday everhelping some guy buy food for his dogsraising grand for a womens charityraising grand for suicide prevention Ive honestly seen more positive activism stem from the anonymity culture than I have from any other site.The problem is a lot of people only understand the surface of chan boards like chan and equate the anonymity as some cheap way for them to be hateful under the guise of free speech but that couldnt really be further from the truth. To understand why the board encourages to hate is to understand who goes there and its obviously the social outcasts. So why would a bunch of social outcasts who get made fun of encourage hate and let such raw emotion reign supreme? Quite honestly it dilutes it. Getting called a faggot on chan constantly helps you to brush it off when you hear it on the street and the nice thing about the anonymity of the chan board is essentially you have a new identity with each post letting you brush it off even more. That last post you made someone made fun of you well cool no one knows that the person who just made the post people are laughing at was the same post they were making fun of. Youre no longer the faggot youre the comedian until you make a new post and youre the troll.chan style sites dont create pessimistic negative and depressed people it just attracts them and quite honestly its nice to be able to show raw emotion and not have it permanently tied to your identity. You never have to worry about people being like oh that dude that dude always has problems ignoredIve used chan a bunch of times to let out my problems about being depressed suicidal and raped. Its wonderful because I can let it all out and continue to be a member of that community without the community permanently tying what happened to me to my identity.If I fully discussed my rape irl i was always going to feel broken because everyone I talked to would then associate it with my identity and it would be something I would never escape. Even on reddit i was originally hesitant to be open about it because of the username system would tie it to my reddit identity. But on chan I could discuss it all i wanted and it was a massive emotional relief. In real life you dont know if your emotional troubles are going to annoy or be a burden to whoever is kind enough to listen you dont know if theyre just being kind and dont truly care but on chan style board if no one cares theyre not going to respond and if they feel your problems are stupid they grant you the right to start over immediately and dont force anyone to carry their past with them.Its the mindset i got from chan that helps me and others move on from our problems that we shouldnt drag them around to each new thing we do but instead move on and start over.Its this aspect that attracts the people you describe the site however doesnt create these people it merely attracts them and for many like myself helps them get out of that mindset in their real life. Ive been browsing that site for years and arguably im more optimistic and positive because ive been exposed to that raw humanity.I wrote all of this in all honesty not thinking anything would change your view based on your last sentence.As it seems you hold the belief that even if people like myself dont feel they are being effected by this site negatively you are insisting they are and are just ignorant to their own emotions and experiences.'},\n",

Throughout human history conquerors with superior technology have succeeded over less capable and less innovative cultures. Its ruthless yes but the reality is conquered cultures were less capable than the victors. Therefor it is in the best interest of cultures to strive for innovation invention progress technology and science. Not only does this secure survivability but also increases standard of living.Colonel Quaritch as well as the other miners were there to extract resources which benefited this endeavor. They were striving to better their abilities through use of the metal under the tree the Navi inhabited. Arguably Colonel Quaritch COULD have massacred the residents of Hometree. It was well within his ability and means. Instead a chance to evacuate is given and Quaritches forces target Hometree itself not the Navi The fleet do not gun down the fleeing residents nor do they pursue. Their goal was the resources under the tree and not the extermination of the people.Next Quaritch ceases hostilities against the Navi until Jake assembles a massive force around the headquarters. Quaritch COULD have met them in battle but instead what does he do? Tries to avoid direct bloodshed by taking out a cultural symbol thus potentially avoiding loss of life among both Navi and Human. The culture of the Navi could have ended up like the Native Americans. Conquered but preserved through merciful reservations granted by the victors. Instead they opted for resistance and Im interested to see what the sequel holds for them. In the mean time I feel Colonel Quaritchs actions were rational reasonable justifiable and the correct course of action.

Large operations like this are risk averse for a reason. Fighting is a risk you dont have to take. While these minerals were deemed worthy of exploitions I can not imagine any company in our world who would not spend money to find other stuff to sell from that world. In this case the Hometree or whatever it was had the capabilities to store souls. Now ask yourself If you had the choice between cool rocks which make your fancy chair fly or true immortality What do you think is worth more money?For me this whole story was about arrogance ignorance and greed. They had the chance to earn so much more money to mutually benefit from this encounter.

Items arent of the game and arent of what distinguishes it from other games.Whats the intended purpose of the game? Well its a versatile game that applies to a very very wide audience. Some people prefer some things and some people prefer other things. If I play a game I want to maximize the amount of fun I have while doing it. Some people think items add to the fun like you and others think that they remove the fun.Would you say that olympic racewalking is inherently more competitive than olympic running? Restrictions dont make it any more or less competitive.Going into specific examples lets say an item spawns next to Player A that lets them if used correctly knock out Player B. Player A will need to skillfully use this item to knock out Player B correct?Now lets say that the game has been even until then and both people have life left. Whoever is better will win. However Player A gets an item that will let them with the right timing knock out Player B. Player A also has the option to pretend the item doesnt exist and play normally.Therefore Player A arbitrarily gets extra option compared to Player B and a higher chance of success. Now of course this is a hypothetical situation but you can probably see how this can apply to a regular game. It can add interest. However in a normal game of focus is on players actions. Everything that happens is an action by either Player A or Player B. Adding items adds stuff that is done by neither Player A nor Player B but instead done by the game. If you add a random element to a game youd better have a good reason. An arbitrary randomness is usually not good. What if every attack had a in chance of hitting twice as hard for example? It would be balanced it just would be there fore no reason.That isnt random chance. Thats a mistake the player makes. These are avoided at all costs. Sometimes games are even replayed if the glitch is severe enough.I think that that could be good. However what determines mainstream?

Imagine how it would feel to see a player with better skills lose just because their opponent got a pokeball with Kyogre in it. Or they got the hammer. Or the invincibility star. Or any of the other items that introduce an unfair advantage. I agree that items can make the game more fun especially if the people playing all have different skill levels I personally think that playing with no items against an opponent with a similar skill level is extremely fun. But people dont always play games and sports at a competitive level because they are having fun. They do it because its a thing theyre good at that they can get paid for. The fun is a nice bonus. I think a key thing to realize here is that fun probably isnt the reason the majority of people play competitive matches. Whenever you do something competitively you want that thing to have as little luck involved as possible. Thats why the only gambling games done professionally competitively are the ones where the players have the ability to apply some strategy there are professional poker and blackjack players but not professional roulette players or slot machine players. Smash with items off is something you can practice at discover what is predictable develop a strategy and prepare for a competition. Smash with items on is a crapshoot. No one in their right mind will enter a competition they are one luckyforyouropponent Palkia pokeball away from losing. The only way I could even entertain your argument is if in competitive play only some small subset of the items were allowed just the dragoon and the blaster could be interesting. But the more items that are used increases the more the unpredictability of what can happen in any given match also increases and in a game with players there is a tipping point. Even if there is skill involved in using certain items many of them introduce too much of an imbalance for a competitive player to be comfortable with especially if there is money involved.As far as people not using the game the way it is intended I dont know what to tell you. This is kind of just how humanity progresses. The inventor of basketball did not have its current NBA incarnation in mind. And Henry Ford did not have the Ford Focus in mind when he designed the Model T but arent we all glad people changed things along the way so that we have what we have now?

Experience tends to have a tempering effect on information that can often be difficult to quantify. Just as youve arrived at your own point of view on experience through your experience events change the way we can view identical information. If someone researches loss for instance it may be easy to develop an academic view of the subject but that knowledge does not confer what the actual experience of loss is like or how difficult it can be to deal with. In the same way that knowing how to lose weight doesnt often translate into success with losing weight.The greatest benefit my own experience has conferred on me is a great awareness of what its like to be wrong. Ive been wrong about a lot. It has gradually made me less and less certain over the years and so Im a lot less concerned than I once was about whether or not Im right. It also tends to make me more open to being wrong so if someone points out a flaw in my reasoning Im quicker to give up my old point of view in favor of seeing things differently.A study conducted by Richard West at James Madison University found that contrary to what one might expect people who scored very high on SATs or other standardized methods of evaluating cognitive or collegiate ability had a surprising vulnerability to certain kinds of test questions such asA bat and ball cost a dollar and ten cents. The bat costs a dollar more than the ball. How much does the ball cost?While our initial thought might be that the ball costs ten cents this is actually incorrect. The correct answer is that the bat costs a dollar and five cents and that the ball costs five cents.Intelligent people Richard West found were more prone to relying on heuristics or mental short cuts to solve problems and that this made them MORE likely than the average person to be vulnerable to certain cognitive biases.In some instances it is the very clarity with which we see that world that is our biggest barrier to seeing it accurately. This is where experience is most helpful. Its not just having the book knowledge that is important. Its having the relevant life experience that brings that knowledge into its full three dimensions.As your own arguments have developed youve become frustrated with the ability of others who often may not argue well. This would likely not have developed had you not honed your own skills through direct experience. At your age youve likely not honed these skills as far as you will at some point either. In other words as skilled as you feel at developing your arguments now youll be better in a year. Even better than that in two or three. You cant help it. Youll have a greater well to draw from then just as you have a greater well to draw from now than you did a couple years ago.All of this isnt in defense of those who dismiss your arguments out of hand as a result of their prejudice about your age. Thats a failing on their part. But just because others arent fair with you in terms of acknowledging the validity of your arguments on their face value doesnt mean that experience isnt a relevant factor in deepening understanding of all kinds of things.

This is the deep and inherent flaw to Sola Scriptura as well as the fact that everyone just can come up with whatever they want it to say but thats a whole different can of worms.If you are willing to look past the literal letter of the scripture its rather clear. Marriage is explicitly enshrined as an institute for reproduction multiple times. Further more sexual immorality is explicitly condemned in the context of homosexuality among other things as being part of this. This is the more pressing issue however the Church likely would never consider a person to ever be any gender than the one God made them. Or in other words it would be condemned as homosexuality becuase you cannot change the gender that God gave you. You cant really actually change it with science either but dont say that to loud people get threatenedThe single biggest reason though is that changing your gender is in effect spitting in the face of God. If he is all knowing and all loving you were made the way you were for a purpose. In changing your gender you are saying God you got it wrong. I am aware that people who feel this way do not choose to and are often times very nice people. Too bad thats not a good enough reason. We all have crosses to bear and the big idea is the more faithfully you bear it the better things go for you once you die. I would go so far as to say that there likely have been gaytrans Saints in church history the became saints precisely because they controlled their passions and urges and mastered them. Not because they gave in. Heres my final note I have studied the bible in its original Greek I know church history and dogma fairly well I have a copy of all the canonical cannons sitting about feet away from me. To ask can we define gender as biological based on the Bible is akin to asking can we declare UFOs as real based on the encyclopedia brittanica. No you cannot as the writers would have rejected the notion of transgender prima facie. Progressive ism and the gospels are in fundamental opposition and cannot and will not ever be reconciled. And as someone who speaks greek fluently and has read the septugiant in its original the number of groups coming up with their own translations that specifically twist mistranslate and omit to fit their agendas is disgusting.But I dont feel the need to tell anyone this.

For an incredibly cheap price or sometimes at no price at all you can listen to almost any song your heart desires or watch any movie that strikes your interest. Yes it is true that both of these services do not have literally everything but as the years go on these services will only get better to the point where it is virtually impossible to not have access to a movie or song. Storage devices will only continue to increase in storage capacity. Why own a disc that takes up physical space in your household when you can download all of your TV shows movies and music onto your computer? Many people today are creating their own home servers with tons of storage space to hold all their media. Granted this is a bit difficult for those who are not tech savvy but a few years from now Im positive that obtaining a server for your media and being able to place media on it will become an incredibly simple process.As one final less important point physical media is restricted in its quality.

In this argument the fetus is being treated as a part of the womans body and therefore the woman is free to make decisions without consideration for the wellbeing of the fetus and its future.Men should be on the hook for child support because we shouldnt be focused on the parents but rather the wellbeing of the childThis also makes perfect sense. Even if the parents are arguing the needs of the parents shouldnt be placed before the needs of the child.However if we take the argument that women should have control of their own bodies without consideration for the future of their fetus then it should also be right to say that men should have control of their own life without consideration for the future of their fetus.If we take the argument that the wellbeing of the child should come before the wellbeing of the parents then I also think that it is fair to say that a woman should not freely be able to choose whether to get an abortion without consideration for the wellbeing of the childs future.I find it extremely unfair that a woman who cannot financially or emotionally support a child has the right to have a kid because she has a right to control her own body but when it comes to men their life savings can be forcefully taken away because the future of the child should be placed before the rights of a man.Therefore I believe that men should either have abortion rights or the right to waive all financial obligations to his child while abortion is still an option.Note Im not trying to make this into a male vs. female thing.

It would be better to break it down further so that they are taxed on the first k on the next k and on the next k.

With a single formula there are no jumps and this leads to a fairer tax system.Heres a graph of a function which I came up with the very rich pay tax on their salary and those earning pay tax. Of course no one earns but this could easily be adjusted so that minimum wage earners pay and those slightly above minimum pay very little.One of Adam Smiths canons of taxation is that the tax system should be simple or understandable by the public. This means that the bands system is more attractive because of its simplicity but I do not think that it is too complicated to be practical. The function would not require more than so a simple calculator could do the job. The example I gave a graph of is just cS where S is salary and c is a constant that determines how quickly the result reaches tax rate.The taxing function could be evaluated and the public could be supplied with other formulae for answers to questions like If I get a raise from k to k how much does my income go up by? so the taxing system remains simple to the public.',\n",

A gym could cater to women by having more private workout booths and a good security presence to achieve the same feeling of safety. A gym can also respond promptly to complaints of inappropriate behavior from members and then ban them from the facility.

However despite its shortcomings I believe that the real heart of the Mass Effect franchise lies not with the story or the narrative but with its characters. With only a couple exceptions the vast majority of Shepards crew are interesting fleshedout characters each with their own flaws and redeeming qualities. For example SPOILERS ME seeing Wrex grow from a mere gunforhire in ME to the responsible yet still badass leader of the Genophagefree Krogan in ME was one of the most gratifying experiences of my gaming career. Similarly the leap of faith Shepard takes when trusting Legion on Rannoch thus ending hundreds of years of conflict and bringing the Quarians and Geth together was immensely satisfying and could easily qualify for rfrission material. Without these experiences yeah Mass Effect didnt live up to the hype. How could it? Its such a hollow victory watching Wreav royally screw things up or watching Tali commit suicide.

Regardless of paragon or renegade alignment I believe there is one right way to play Mass Effect a completionist run where NO ONE dies. I need help guys.

It was there to be seen by players and to be experienced by them. And sometimes tragedies are more fun than victories. I did do the completionist run! I had a closeted gay paragon Shepard because I thought it was hilarious and he eventually shacked up with Kaidan saved the world let no one die then picked destroy ending because why not. It went well okay I guess. However after that I wanted some real emotional punches. I was pissed as hell at the ME ending and I dont think as another fan youll need me to elaborate on why I loved those characters and I hated how little involvement they had in how things went and the ending was a total slap in the face to the player and all their work until that point so I thought you know what I want a Shepard where this kind of ending makes sense. Where an ending thats a fuck you to everything Shepards been trying comes as the topping of a fuck you in the chain of everything that Shepards done. Where it isnt a betrayal of all the themes that have been brought up so far but the logical extension of them instead.And so I made the worlds giantest asshole most selfjustifying Shepard. And if you ask me? Its about as far as you can get from your completionist Shepard but taken with MEs ending I think it makes for a far better story. A renegade lady who wasnt xenophobic as much as very prohuman straight but distrusted Jacob and uninterested in any of the alien male love interests and who killed Kaidan in ME woops. Who was alone from start to end in a quest that only she seemed to really believe in. Trust me when you play a character whos a lot more of an asshole but whos a really determined asshole who keeps losing stuff and who has people die but who convinces herself that its worth something that her mission has to be worth all that who is willing to make sacrifices that she believes are necessary when you the player know that they arent the bad ends in ME make for a fantastic experience. Its basically the game going well Shepard you fucked up and this is what you get for it. Theyre not hollow at all theyre fantastic. The entire game and story turns into Shepard realizing too late that things couldve been different and that the state of the universe going to shit is on them. They lose everyone who trusted them in some way or another and hurt through it all. The finale of ME goes from a completely unsatisfying throughly annoying ending that ignored the themes of choice and selfdetermination that had been going on through the game into one final desperate chance to make it right instead. Whatever Shepard picks I felt a lot more satisfied with that story as a whole instead of the no one dies run where it didnt really matter that no one died and that they worked so fucking hard for that just pick choice A B or C and thats your ending for you.Shitty failure Shepards ending was also a dialogue choice but that just underscored that shed burned and destroyed anything else around her that no one else would stand by her side that everyone was dead and this was all she had left. To me that kind of ending fit much better with the way Id played her and I felt far more vicious satisfaction putting that sort of character through it. Every other possible ending that couldve been shed gone and wrecked through her own shitty actions. Losing all the choices at the end made sense this time in the context of her experiences.Anyway I still enjoyed the everyonelives playthrough but Id say that the everyone dies route seeing as it is there also was meant to be played and in fact works pretty well as an overall story where Shepard is the one thats screwed up the whole way. I dont think of it as me killing of those characters off its whatever Shepard Im playing in that particular runthrough thats doing it a vicious angry bitter and ultimately futile Shepard. The emotional payoff on finishing the series went from are you serious is that actually the ending the fuck to HAHA YES Shepard fucking deserved that that was great. TLDR The right way to play it is to experience everything that is there and then figure out what makes you the most satisfied. For me that wasnt a completionist run. I can play as saves everyone Shepard and also as total stupid asshole Shepard neither of them are metheplayer theyre just the main characters in their own stories. The one I find the most hilarious and interesting is the one whose story makes the most sense as a whole and thats the one where Shepard totally fails save anyone including herself.'},\n",

I dont think youll find many people who disagree that the American legal system could be slimmed down substantially.Ill make two quick points with the idea of persuading you that while it should be simplified a substantial degree of complexity is necessary for certain aspects to function.First take criminal law. Lets assume that laws are created on the premise that they outlaw an action that is morally bad. That sounds fine and dandy at first but who defines what is morally bad? Some things are clear cut hitting a small child would be morally bad. But what if hitting them prevented some greater harm? Going down this train of logic will ultimately lead to a purely utilitarian theory on the legal system. That isnt to say that it would be better or worse than ours currently but given the immense literature on utilitarianism I doubt any high schooler could reasonably be expected to memorize it.Second lets look at regulation by profession specifically bank regulation. If you havent heard of DoddFrank well lucky you. Its a odd page legislative titan. I would hardly believe it couldnt be slimmed down some yet a lot of it is necessary for a functional judicial system to determine what is and is not legal. Take the Volcker rule and prop. trading. Thats explicitly illegal now well kind of... not yet. There isnt a huge moral justification to regulations such as these other than they increase risk and excessive risk is bad. But who defines what excessive risk is? If you have a probability of default of is that bad? Is acceptable? What about ? Even better what about . versus ? Some of these things just ultimately need someone saying Enough! Well agree on or we will agree to disagree. and to codify it. However that codification even if is only one line applied to hundreds of laws would be immense.In short my two points were . We could create a system that simply pointed to morally impermissible actions as illegal but that would lead to large discrepancies or would need have some other system to define what is morally impermissible out of scope of a high schoolers memory. . In order to eliminate discrepancies the system needs to codify at least some specific instances and by doing such for an immense number of actions we go beyond well any one persons memory.'},\n",

I like them both for different reasons but gun to my head I probably slightly prefer the films.The hobbit movies can S my D though.IMO the extended cuts seriously throw off the pacing of the films. When watching the theatrical cuts I get swept into the story. When watching the extended cuts I get distracted and reminded that Im watching a movie. They break the fourth wall if you will.Peter Jackson agrees with meThe main objection to this of course will be that the extended cuts are able to include more scenes from the books and are therefore better. Personally I think its a huge mistake to judge the quality of an adaptation by how closely it mirrors the source material rather than by the strength of its story telling. The LOTR movies are some of the best adaptations of all time precisely because they left a whole lot of the books unfilmed and a whole lot more on the cutting room floor. They stretched some scenes from brief chapters into center pieces Helmss Deep and cut out some of the more... esoteric portions completely Tom Bombadil.Basically Im glad Jackson opted to make excellent movies instead of attempting a shot for shot visualization of a book and I think the extended cuts subvert his success in that regard.Books and movies are not the same and in general the more an adaptation respects the inherent differences between the various media its adapting to and from the better the final product will be. This is much more important than its faithfulness to the source material. I believe this is true for all adaptations not just LOTR. Feel free to C my V on this larger point as well.',\n",

And Im the sort of person who despite not really liking to read will read summaries about the world surrounding my favorite movies or video games because these are things I want to know but typically arent in the filmgame so I endure the chore. I love that the extended edition helped with this especially in this situation because most of the answers to that on the internet before were If you want to know more you should just read the damn books scrub! because nerds are like that sometimes.'},\n",

Cheating as I define it is a choice. A bad choice which breaks one of the cornerstones of marriage. You are correct that this is false. However I would say that cheaters are more likely to cheat again. The circumstances that resulted in cheating the first time may repeat. Yes. But talking about the problem is an ideal situation. It often doesnt work out so well that way. People get stuck in a pattern... living in the same house married to the same person you stopped really caring about. Cheating is evidence that something must be wrong. So so far we can say cheating is a bad choice which breaks one of the cornerstones of a relationship is an indication that such a thing will happen again is an indication that there is a problem with the relationshipAre there no situations in which the cheaters should be forgiven? Im trying to argue that if you find your spouse cheating breaking up with them is the most logical thing to do whatever the circumstances. I point out cheating has a profound negative emotional effect of the person cheated on. You have every reason to break up. In my mind marriage is a commitment. If you break that commitment the marriage is broken. One partner isnt fulfilling all of hisher obligations i.e. not to cheat So why should the other person be obligated to fill out hishers? Why should you stay married?It is entirely up to the person making the decision as to what they may do. Its an ethical question and everyone has their different values so its impossible to prove definitively what you shouldshould not do. Its just a logical conclusion that breaking up is the right choice in most if not all situations. Its a choice.But if you dont break up you are stuck with a person who doesnt value you enough to stay loyal. Why would you forfeit yourself to such a relationship?Things need change.

       "  'counters': 'Since you mentioned the DSM IV it is worth pointing out that all of the disorders listed in the DSM IV have one central piece of criteria that is at the heart of the diagnostic process which I believe youve missed and that has to do with the degree to which the disorder is disruptive not only to the person who has the disorder but to the general public as well if you doubt this read through the criteria for any disorder listed in the DSM.Generally speaking delusions themselves are arguably less relevant to whether or not a behavior is indicative of a disorder than are the social repercussions of that behavior. Take for instance being taken by the holy spirit. From an outside perspective this certainly appears to me to be a delusional behavior but of course this alone is not enough for it to meet the criteria of a particular disorder. As people can engage in all kinds of delusional behavior and often still function in the world quite well this is not sufficient evidence for whether or not something should or should not be constituted as evidence of a disorder.The belief that one has an animal spirit is not new and has been a component of many primitive animistic cultures throughout history and certain Native American practices still have vestiges of this though most of us wouldnt describe them as delusional simply because they follow the traditions of their ancestors as theyve been practiced for centuries.While you may find the practice disingenuous or disgusting this is not reason enough to hold the behavior as evidence of a specific disorder in and of itself and in cases where there may be genuine mental illness involved I believe that theres enough criteria already set forth in the DSM to diagnose these conditions accurately without directly addressing this particular cultural phenomenon as some kind of mental health outlier.'},\n",

       "  'counters': 'This is one of those views that likes to view production capital labor and all of economics as a zero sum game. Its not. Money circulates multiple times in a system and value is created at each stage. I.e. youre simplifying it down to a level where it doesnt show all of the uses of the money that actually happen. I could reduce this down to the absolute simplest case and thus reduce the entire argument to absurdity a single worker who owns all of his own tools that he made himself makes a doll out of parts he gathers or makes at no cost to himself. The doll is worth . But since no one in this system actually has no one can buy that doll and therefore it goes to waste. Do you see why this reasoning breaks down because it leaves out a lot of economic activity outside of the example shown? Nothing about scaling that up to a factory changes the reasoning. The reasoning is just oversimplified and wrong. In reality all of the money received by the factory for the dolls goes to someone. One problem is that typically most companies arent owned by the bosses. They are owned by the owners of the company which are many and varied often including the workers in many cases. The excess value goes to all of them who spend it on many things.Of perhaps some of it is retained as capital by the owners. But what does that really mean? People dont actually horde money in couches. They invest it in other productive stuff such as new factories that produce more stuff someone has to pay the people that build the factories or money that is borrowed by people to start their own businesses. Now yes some businesses fail and that is by and large where most of the surplus value is wasted. But only in a very narrow sense because in the process of being wasted it ended up going to other people for the businesses purchases payrolls etc. Additionally the businesses that succeed end up generating more economic activity. This is no different from any other system BTW. In communism surplus value is also either created or alternately and more likely a shortage occurs because not enough was produced. The only difference is where the money goes. In realworld examples of communist states the money goes to the state which wastes a lot of it in overhead and useless production as well. Or in some kinds of communism it goes back to the workers.Another problem with your view is that factory owners have a lot of ways of disposing of excess inventory and a lot of incentive to not create excess inventory in the first place. Other systems have less incentive for these corrections to happen and as a practical matter end up generating even more waste because the people making the decisions about production dont have as much incentive to get those decisions right.'},\n",

Youll owe the military tons of time for the training so you wont be able to enter civilian practice for years.

One reason I take this stance is because the newly released games are ectremely similar to their predecessors. There are few if any changes in gameplay and the basic level design for the most part remains the same. Even Advanced Warfare which seemed to promise the most novel changes was criticized for changing too little from its preceding games.Another reason for my opinion is that CoD doesnt really have anything astoundingly different from other games of the same genre. There are a few unique features here and there but overall its just another FPS with nothing spectacular that sets it above the other games in its genre.',\n",

Youre entirely in your right to feel that CoD is overrated and personally it seems futile to change this view. You like what you like. I can only provide objective points to maybe calibrate your perspective.So back to numbers dont lie. Consider the goal the creators of CoD have. To make money. And they consistently perform this goal well year after year. Now youre an executive of ActivisionBlizzard. Why would you tell the developers to do a complete on the series for changes sake.? You only run risk and very little reward. If you stick to the tried and true model theyve had youre very nearly guaranteed to make a certain amount of sales. Im sure they can graph the sales of each subsequent game and make predictions to the gradual decline with each passing year as more and more individuals grow bored of the CoD formula. Really your view of overrated and overhyped is nothing more than an idiosyncratic reflection of your own personal threshold for formulaic video games. But this view is separate from the objective success of the series. If they keep selling games it means people still enjoy the series for what it is. The idiom Dont fix what isnt broken comes to mind. There are more people who still like the series and will buy new iterations without much change compared to the minority who do find it cliche hackneyed etc. I mean be realistic here if they promised the most radically new CoD next year would you buy it? Probably not. You have a bias against the series. Why would their target audience be the people who dont like CoD? It makes no sense.The other major point is that video game development is extremely expensive. Making an entirely new engine is costly takes years to develop and you never have a guarantee of financial success upon release. It makes more sense to stick with the old engine and old code which drastically reduces the time and therefore cost it takes to make a new game. Brand new engine CoDs likely wouldnt make sufficiently more money to offset their cost to make it. They arent a charity so gamers arent entitled to it.'},\n",

Youve drawn this fine line where something that is done for attention cannot also be done for empowerment which I find to be the crux of your dilemma. If someone is confident in their body is it not empowering to have other people give you reassurance of that position? The definition of empowering is to make someone stronger and more confident. If the feedback about their bodies does that then so be it. People seem to get very morally judgmental about how the internet has made us all so much more open. We share so much and censor so much less... but why is this necessarily a bad thing? If no harm is done what problem is there in using the internet for such exchange? Like it or not the platforms websites have provided have made a level playing field for anyone to find some kind of minor celebrity with a paparazzi of their anonymous peers. If the attrition of that kind of fan base is what empowers her so be it. It may be complex for those in relationships who want more exclusivity but thats more an interpersonal problem than a denial of empowerment.'},\n",

There are some exceptions that justify regulation such as environmental or fraud protection but I dont think networking is one of them the reason being just how expensive it is to find employees without using networking. Simply getting an employee in the door often costs about years worth of their salary with that money going to the recruiters that found the person paying people to review their resume interview them do background checks etc. Then after they start working they have to be trained and get up to speed on their new job which depending on the job can often take months. If all of this time and money goes towards a bad hire that is an extremely bad thing for the business which means that its extremely important to minimize the number of bad hires.

Throughout history people tend to use their wealth to show off how much wealth they have. The status symbols change over time but the existence of status symbols doesnt. There was a time say in the th century where the elite would wear quite elaborate clothing. Check out this picture of Louis XIV Hes dressing in elaborate fantastical clothing to tell everyone look how rich and powerful I am. I can afford to waste resources on immense amounts of expensive fabric. Nowadays you would never see a wealthy leader dressing like this. Clothes have become cheap thus they are no longer useful as a status symbol. Certain elite brands are used to show off wealth but the suit the president wears is little different in form than the suit you can buy down at Walmart. His suit is just higher quality and better fitted.Or consider beauty standards. Back during the Victorian Era it was very fashionable for women of class to have extremely pale skin. When most of the populace lived on farms or walked to work in a factory most people got tan quite easily. Only the rich could afford to be pale. Nowadays where most people work office jobs retail jobs food service etc tanning is a luxury good a sign you have enough spare time to sit in the sun or money to go to a tanning salon.So what would the luxury goods be for a postscarcity society? In such a society the cost of most physical goods would approach zero. Raw materials would be extracted by robots. Energy would come from cheap robotproduced solar farms. Robots would assemble and repair other robots. The cost of most physical goods in a true postscarcity society is near zero. Sure a common laborer could buy a thousand copies of a Lexus but whats the point? Even someone working at Burger King could afford to put together a copy of Louis XIVs outfit but no one ever does. Its just seen as silly and ridiculous possibly even a sign of mental illness.So what would rich people spend their money on? What are the status goods of postscarcity society? Well real estate could certainly be one. The cost to build a house may be zero but land certainly isnt. Still this can be ameliorated by highrises. Lots of people can afford to live in a ritzy downtown area if a highquality high rise can be built to next for nothing. Owning a singlefamily home in a highquality area would be a status symbol but just living their wouldnt.So without that what do we have? About the only thing you can buy with your money at that point is humanintensive services. Sure you could use a robot to clean your house but do you want people to think you are poor? Show off your wealth by hiring a butler instead. You could put your kid through a MOOC to teach them algebra but youre better than that. Hire an expensive private tutor instead. You could have a robot do your hair or nails but really? What are you a common peasant? Pay for the fancy salon instead and show off your fabulous wealth. You could use a driverless car but having someone drive you around is just so much more classy.

       "  'arguments': 'Like many American kids I was often forced throughout my childhood to participate in Monopoly games with my family. From what I can tell there is very little skill involved in playing the game it just seems to be a giant crapshoot the whole way through.Monopoly was made with the intent to explain why localised monopolies are bad for the economy and to explain the Single Tax theory of Henry George. Though it does this job well I believe it is this intent that causes it to be thoroughly not fun. Once of the board has been claimed even if the landholdings of all the players are about equal it is immediately obvious which player will lose based on who falls in anothers territory first and has to pay the incredulous tax. After that it is just a long fall into bankruptcy as eventually the player has to sell their property to others decreasing the chance that they can earn revenue while simultaneously increasing the chance that the others can profit from them.While this system would work in a quick game between to people monopoly is usually drawn out and played with players. One after another a player pays out the networth to the other players until there is a long long drawnout standoff between the remaining few. At this point it comes to down to complete and utter chance. Whomever gets the worst successive dice rolls loses. When that happens barring any statistically unlikely dice rolls it is evident who will lose. But the game keeps going and going because it would be unfair to keep going despite the likely outcome.If Monopoly was redesigned to rely less on chance perhaps a redesign of the board more mechanics to tip the scales of chance perhaps with better Chance cards or even removal of the pieces entirely and to be quicker Add penalties for each additional player over so that the success and failures of each decision weigh more heavily for example then the game will be much more fun and enjoyable to everyone. As of right now after the first few passes around the board it is easier to calculate the theoretical outcome with the help of a computer then to finish the game to its completion.Please change my view for the sake of family game night. ampnbsp',\n",
       "  'counters': 'First are you actually playing monopoly according to the base rules? I have to ask because its very very common for people to unwitting ignore or add rules and cause the game to run longer. By far the most egregious violation of this nature is ignoring the Auction rule where if the player who lands on an unbought space chooses not to buy it for face value it is auctioned off to highest bidder which makes it take much longer for people to build up property dragging out the early stages of the game. Another common one I grew up with was the Free Parking rule addition where landing on Free Parking confers some kind of monetary reward which introduces more money into the game and makes it harder to go bankrupt dragging out the game. Assuming that youre playing with auctions and preferably without that Free Parking house rule the key to the game is negotiation. The game only becomes a drawnout slugfest if players cant get monopolies which only happens if players dont negotiate. This is the soul of the game and ignoring it is the reason many people develop a distaste for the game. If players A B C and D are playing and A is obviously ahead after a few goarounds should A just win? Of course not! B C and D should be conspiring like hell to take A down. B can not notice when C and D land on his properties making A the only one to pay rent. C and D can agree to help each other complete monopolies and make trades of that nature. Once some players have monopolies the other players have to either trade to make their own monopolies or get bled out quickly. Once monopolies and the corresponding houses and hotels come into play tiny rents become enormous and the game quickly comes to an end.In short Monopoly is drawn out because people dont play by the rules or the miss the main point of the game monopolies. Forming monopolies is by far the quickest way to win and the easiest way to do so is through negotiating with other players a point that many Monopoly players fail to notice. A properly played game of Monopoly may come down to luck in the end but its luck that is heavily influenced by the midgame which is decided by the players diplomatic skill.'},\n",

Theres no reason to have a complicated calendar just because some ancient emperors had oversized egos. has few factors so a perfect division is not practical but we can at least do better than what we have months have days and months have for example month would get Leap Day. Months do not line up with seasons. The equinoxes and solstices that define the seasons. Why have the season start of the way through the month when they could just happen on the first or second making that entire month in one season or close enough? It would also keep the months as part of division hierarchy four seasons to a year three months to a season. As a consequence of this change the year also wouldnt start in the middle of winter.

Edit Based on some of the responses Ive been getting it seems like a lot of places use the term season more colloquially with summer just meaning when the days are longer and warmer rather than the space between the summer solstice and the autumnal equinox.

School and financial years are misaligned with calendar years. Why have the school year when one could make the entire year line up with the calendar? This one has been answered Financial years have no set times and school years vary too much by region to try to align them with a universal calendar. View changed in this respect.These are the three particular objections I have. To change my view explain why these problems are necessary or at least why fixing them would cause other problems apart from the practicality of adopting a new system to begin with.I am well aware that actually getting the world to adopt a new calendar is highly impractical but such practical concerns are beside my point so I dont intend to argue about that. Im also not going to bother with appeals to tradition.So change my view.Theres been some confusion regarding my intentions here. I am well aware that the costs of switching calendars would be huge and not worthwhile for the relatively small benefits of having a more consistent system. However if I allowed for that consideration when constructing my post I wouldnt have bothered to post it because my view would have already been changed.The basic question Im interested in is this are there good reasons to have any of the inconsistencies that the Gregorian calendar currently has? If we were to make a calendar from scratch is there any reason to have irregular months rather than regular ones? Is there any reason to have the year start in the middle of winter rather than changing at the same time as a new season? These are the parts of this that I want to hear about not whether it can be implemented.If it helps you focus on the matter at hand heres a rephrase I have a button that once pressed will retroactively switch the current calendar to one with the fixes I describe above. This change is instant seamless and will carry no cost apart from the effort to press the button. Convince me not to press it.',\n",
       "  'counters': 'The year is not actually days long. Its days hours minutes and seconds long. Your perfect redivision would have to account for this. This is why leap years exist currently. An astrophysicist developed a new calendar with a pattern of that repeats and then accounts for the extra time with a leap week in December every five or six years. This calendar is called the HankeHenry permanent calendar. Every single year would be identical. Christmas would always fall on a Sunday for example. Your birthday would always be on the same day of the week in perpetuity. The pattern of is pretty much a requirement or some alternating pattern at any rate due to the way the solar year works.The developer of the HankeHenry calendar states that the main reason to avoid changing the calendar is a psychological one. Many people would be very sad that their birthday would never fall on a nice lazy Saturday for example. His calendar contains four Friday the ths every year. The main reason to make the change is purely financial. Even the developer of the HankeHenry calendar claims that the Gregorian calendar is extremely accurate and the only thing he truly dislikes about it is daydrift meaning that April st isnt always a Tuesday or whathaveyou.

       "  'arguments': 'Ill define a financial abortion as Giving up the parental rights to a child you fathered. It involves not having to pay child support.Ive seen this concept floating around and initially dismissed it completely as guys wanting to shirk responsibility and be deadbeats. I also thought it could be too easily exploited especially if men got cold feet about having a baby and after claiming to support the woman decided to screw her over by taking the financial abortion option.However Ive thought up ways in which such a law could actually be feasible.. If intending to get child support from the father of a child the woman MUST inform him as soon as possible about the state of her being pregnant at least by the th week. Maybe he can sign a document saying he knows shes pregnant.. The father can only decide to opt out and have the financial abortion up until the th week of pregnancy. If he doesnt opt out by then he loses the right to opt out. The week thing is because pregnancy is pretty obvious by then but the womans body hasnt been morphed much it looks like. This can be changed I just based it off looking at pictures.These laws mean that a woman can decide with plenty of time left over for contemplating abortion if she wants to keep a baby and raise it as a single mom. If she cant raise it on her own she might want to abort with no great medical risk compared to the risks of pregnancy.I think it would be immoral to bring a child into the world without being capable of providing for it. I think it is also immoral to force a man to pay for a child he didnt want. If a woman cant raise the child without the fathers support the moral thing to do would be to abort the child.This law would obviously be relying on abortion being freely available in the area. It would probably be a very bad idea to implement it in the South of the USA for example.So that this law is feasible. I would like people to discuss loopholes extenuating circumstances and also if this law would be unfair to women in any way. I would also REALLY appreciate it if people explained why they think this is distasteful along with their down vote. Frankly Im sure people will find problems with this VOICE THEM.',\n",

I dont know where to start...Im a year old white guy and straight Ive been single for about years now and before that I was in a relationship for and a half years. I think this is where I started to get bitter. I fell into depression after I broke up with her for sending messages to other guys suggesting she would met up with them for sex. I stumbled across some messages implying she already had but I have no solid evidence. I was a broken man at that point I dont know how best to describe it my inner self was shattered. I think I was like that for about months but its hard to remember all the days just blurred together. She had a new boyfriend in less than a week. I hated the fact that she could just be with someone else so soon more than I hated myself for being so God damn pathetic. I also hated that she told people that I was cheating on her and that I had other girls on the go the whole time. I still had her on Facebook at this point and all the guys commenting where the guys she was sending messages to. Aw dont worry about it babe he was a dick anyway. Do you need a hug? where among the comments she got and it goes without saying that this brought my blood to boil.But it isnt just her that has skewed my view on woman. My mother died when I was and me and my older brother where raised by just my dad. As difficult a child I was he did the best job he could with me. It wasnt until about that he met Helen. She was a early something year old nurse that lived about miles away. She would come down every few weeks to see my dad and spend time with me and my brother. We knew right away that something was wrong with her but being so young we couldnt put our finger on it. After a few more months my dad asked us if it would be OK if she stayed with us all the time and move in of course we didnt object because we could tell in the sound of his voice that he was lonely. Maybe he should have know better or maybe his heart was so desperate for love that he couldnt see that she was a fussy child that thought the universe revolved around who knows? So when she moved in with us it was less than months before she wanted to get a house that belongs to them and we were in a new home. I stayed with them until I was and I moved in with my best friend and my girlfriend and I was glad to be gone. My dad had always been very firm but fair with us never angry or over the top. As soon as we got in to the new house it all changed. It turns out that she didnt want to pay any of the mortgage that had been taken out in both their names. This lead to them arguing all the time. She it seemed just wanted to go to work come home relax and go shopping and housework on the weekends only. I dont think that Oh God its because she a woman that she is so lazy and wont take responsibility! because it turns out that she was still living with her mum when she came to live with us and her mother still did everything for her. Make her meals clean her clothes and didnt take any sort of rent from her. She was a stubborn teenager in an adults body. Now fast forward about years she cheats on my father and moves back into her mums house. My dad also fell into another depression and stopped eating this time and starting drinking. It brought me to tears the first time I saw him a month after she left he looked like a skeleton and he didnt even have the ability to smile. He told me that he got a letter from a solicitor of hers say that she wanted half of what the house they got was worth about I think even though she never paid a penny in to it. Its been sorted now and she is gone for good but over all this time I was losing more and more respect for woman.Then there is the only friend I have right now being controlled by his girlfriend. He has a son with his last girlfriend who also cheated and left him in dept funnily enough and I have to say that he is the most incredible father youve ever met in your life. His son loves him to bits and is so well behaved and respectful to him nothing like I was when I was his age. He sees him times a week and has him every other weekend he sees his family goes to parks and zoos and whatnot he gets along with everyone he loves life and daddy. The mother on the other hand while providing him with everything he needs and Im sure she is a brilliant mother to him has decided to move in with her new boyfriend in a new house about miles away and there isnt anything my friend can do about it. The mother doesnt seem to care too much Hell make new friends you can see him through Skype newboyfriend will be a father figure for him and yes she actually said that. He broke down into tears with this he loves his son more than anything in the world and to be told by the mother that you cant see him as much and being powerless to stop it just fuels more of this sexist view I carry. The mother is moving at the start of the new year and she hasnt told her son and wont let my friend do it either or I will just tell him that you knew he was going all along and that you didnt tell him. Im on the phone to him most nights trying my best to make him feel better however I can but believe it or not he only talks about his son moving away half the time. The other half is about how unsupportive his current girlfriend is being.Now she is only and she probably doesnt know how to support someone going through this. To be honest I dont know how either but Im trying my best. From what he tells me she is just tired of him constantly going on about it and not even trying to cheer up. She is the same as Helen is some respects lives with boyfriend who pays most of the bills always gets driven to and from work which his dad got for her and hates it when he spends a bit of money on something nice for himself. She very much has the Whats mine is mines and whats is yours is mine attitude with everything they have. Shes spoilt selfish and is making an already horrid situation worse by having a shitty attitude about it. She did the same on my birthday party a few weeks ago. We were all having a drink and dancing and having a good time when suddenly Why are you looking at that girls arse? comes from her mouth and the night was downhill from there. We all spent a few hours trying to get her to calm down but she was having none of it her night had been ruined because he saw him staring at some other girl. Later in the night he punched him in the face but he couldnt do anything about it. He wasnt willing to tell some coppers we walked pasted because we knew she would lie and say it was the other way round and that she was the one who was punched or whatever leading him into trouble as Reddit keeps reminding me happens all the time.Wow this is far too long. But all of these experiences combined make me look down on woman in general as just overgrown children. Plus stories on the front page are always woman screwing men over by lying then getting away with it just add fuel to the fire. Its like a quote from Louis C.K Maybe I need more female friends maybe I needed a strong female role model in life but I need to change this toxic view I have. TLDR. Ive had one too many bad experiences involving woman in my life and I hate the fact I cant trust one and find it difficult to respect them.For the love of God Im begging you please help me change my view.',\n",

       "  'arguments': 'HELLO! IF YOURE READING THIS POST AND YOU HAVE NOT FINISHED AVATAR THE LAST AIRBENDER AS WELL AS THE FOURTH BOOK OF LEGEND OF KORRA LIKE WHY? YOU KNOW THERES GONNA BE SPOILERS. ITS YOUR FAULT. STOP OR BE SORRY.Okay. Maybe this is shitty of me as a person. Maybe Im just closedminded and white cisgendered homophobic I hope Im not but hey. But I seem to be one of the like three total fans of Legend of Korra that did not think the series ended the way it should have.Throughout the entire four seasons nearly every character underwent such major development. Mako used to be a selfish asshole who only cared for his brother and probending but at the end of the series he was an independent but caring detective who actively contributed to the safety of not only Republic City citizens but the entire Earth Kingdom. Bolin was an immature kid but at the end of the series he was a matured public speaker who fought for love and for his country. And Korra most of all was a childish uncultured selfimportant bender who didnt know what being the Avatar meant but at the end of the series up until as close as three minutes before the end was an independent mature woman who had learned so much about what it meant to be the Avatar on a global scale. The finale however wherein she is canonically as of tonight romantically matched with Asami a seemingly minor female character completely devalued all character development for her and wrapped up the show in the absolute worst way.. To pair Korra a seemingly strong female character with anyone at all would not do her justice. Avatar Korra is a strong independent Water Tribe woman who dont need no man or uh girl. She broke up with Mako in the second season because she couldnt be with him and be Avatar at the same time which is a theme consistent with The Last Airbender Aang had to let go his earthly tethers to enter the Avatar State. The difference for Aang was that there was a whole three seasons of tension between him and Katara so it was possible for it to happen naturally whereas there was at most being very generous half of a season of very vague and ambiguous um hey I like u for Korra. Even if Korra and Mako or Bolin had gotten together at the end I dont think Id have been as happy as if Korra went on being the Avatar as the strong woman she was made out to be.. To pair Korra with a relatively minor character who was only significant when it was convenient to the team regardless of gender is objectively bad fiction. I dont hate Asami as a character and I dont hate them being paired because theyre both girls and ew yuck same sex. I hate the situation because Asami Sato didnt exist for half of the first season. When she started existing it was to foil Korra which was fine and actually good conflict at the time. Then when its discovered her dad Hiroshi Sato was an Equalist and a villain she joined Team Avatar fulltime. She and Mako and Korra have had romantic conflict since season two but Asami was barely important in season three and slightly more important in season four. I say slightly important and not completely unimportant because she was relevant whenever Team Avatar needed a hiding spotbase of operations a plot weapon or transportation. But seriously Varrick ended up being more important to the plot that Asami and he wasnt even really Team Avatar for three entire seasons.. There is no way this ending wasnt fanservice. This show is the sequel to Avatar The Last Airbender a mature show that the fans called for a sequel to. The first season ended in a murdersuicide. The second season finale completely changed the world of Avatar forever. The third season ended on a terrifying cliffhanger. The fourth and final season finale? Avatar Korra the most powerful bender on the planet and Asami Sato one of the two most intelligent minds on the planet the other being on honeymoon go on vacation in the Spirit World and get romantically involved. While Republic City Zaofu and the Earth Kingdom en masse are in ruins Makos and somewhat Bolins plots are left almost completely unresolved The new Earth King is considering radically changing the structure of the Earth Kingdom the New Air Nation is left nearly forgotten and literally every possible way to end the series logically was unresolved. What!?This relationship is copouty bad writing if it were with anybody literally anyone on the cast but being its the only other female character of any importance makes it that much worse. And its so out of left field! It feels like a fucking fan fiction! Its almost like the directors didnt even care to build to the reveal. Oh and theyre lesbians surprise. THE END.Why wouldnt they just end the series with a TenzinKorra mentorstudent moment or a KorraFather moment or even a tiny reference to Aang and the Gaang or anything other than the new forced relationship between Korra and Asami? Why end the series with a relationship at all?! Not to mention how awkward and ambiguous they had to make it to make it PC enough for Nickelodeon.ugh...Please change my view and make me see how this awkward and seemingly rushed homosexual relationship between Korra and a main character is the best possible resolution for the show. I want to love this show again. Ive been with Avatar since I was in eight grade and loved all of it until the finale of the last season.Not to mention the fandom fucking exploded with a ton of OMG DAE FORSHADOWING FOR EVERY SEASON LOOK THEY OBVIOUSLY LOVE EACH OTHER posts. I cannot fucking stand people devaluing the show entirely as Korras coming out story because she was fighting her sexuality throughout the final season. That shit happened with Frozen and I wouldnt hear it so it infuriates me that this point of view has a foothold thanks to the writers. I refuse to believe that the writers of such amazing fiction in the past would resort to okay now we want you to hate the show so we dont have to do more. I want to see the light dammit.And to clarify I dont care that theyre les or bi or what the fuck ever.

But this doesnt mean all Avatars must never have romantic connections the waterbender Avatar before Korra had a love interests and Roku had a wife!And to further expand on the whole Aang thing he very clearly didnt let Katara go. They kissed at the end of the season and if you pay attention real close in LoK you can even spot their offspring. Aangs conversation with Avatar Yangchen on the Lion Turtle pretty much summed it up the Avatars job is balance and because of that they cannot completly sever their Earthly connection. I think Guru Patik was wrong about this aspect of the Avatar and was trying to bring Aang back to his Airbender roots. All that said pairing Korra with someone romantically doesnt make her not a strong and independant woman. Both her and Asami are independant women who fell in love. Their relationship is clearly not codependent or anything like that. Korra didnt write for two whole years!Did you even watch Book ? Korra and Asami spent something like of that season together. Asami was a pretty important character even back in book ! And while she was pushed to the sideline in book she came back with a bang and is just as part of the krew as Bolin.But really why is pairing up a main character with a minor one not that Asami was mind bad fiction? Should main character romantic interests only involve other main characters or something?As Bryan put it...which fans? Plenty were in your camp and didnt want to see Korrasami become cannon plenty more wanted to see Makorra happen and I think we all wanted to see Bolin hook up with Wing. You cant please all of the fans all of the time and I think its clear that they went with the paring that made sense for the characters.If you think that relationship was rushed yall need to rewatch the rd and th books. Korra and Asami go from friends to best friends to clearly something more by the end. Its slow and building the entire time.Now I want to address your thesis that the Legend of Korra devalued Korras development as a character. Korra was a very headstrong Avatar and thought that the best way out of any situation was to punch it to death. And how does she defeat all of her enemies? Amon punches. Unnavaatu spirit punches. Zaheer Avatar State punches. Kuvira saving her life and talking about their common traits.Kuvira was just about as strong a bender as a nonAvatar can get. She was able to hold her own against Korra and even got the upper hand when she fired the cannon. It was clear that this wasnt a problem Korra was going to be able to punch herself out of. By saving Kuviras life and by talking to her in the spirit world Korra was able to singlehandedly dismantle the Earth Empire. Do you think those dudes in the mechs would have stood down if Korra walked out of there carrying Kuviras body? I dont.The Last Airbender was the story of an Airbender named Aang becoming the Avatar. The Legend of Korra is about an Avatar named Korra becoming the woman she is on the inside. She was no longer defining herself by her title and has started to live life.'},\n",

In Canada and the Common Law world generally these defences have been restricted over time. Also provocation defences are not absolute they would only serve to reduce the charge to manslaughter which I think you suggested in another comment.The standard for these defences is highly restrictive the shock needs to be sufficient to deprive an ordinary unexcitable and not pugnacious person of selfcontrol. It is not enough that you be shocked insulted betrayed offended or repulsed. It must be serious enough to deprive you of responsibility for your own actions. Unfortunately many people are prejudiced against transpersons. This prejudice often manifests itself in the form of an unjustifed fear of sexual dishonesty i.e. that the trans person will trick you into being attracted to them. This defence directly and unavoidably engages that prejudice such that it is unlikely that a judge or jury will assess it reasonably and with the appropriately high bar in mind. And even if some judgesjuries would and no doubt some would it remains the case that it is incredibly difficultimpossible to tell in advance who would and it is further very difficult to change this sort of behaviourprejudice.Lastly the law in general and the law of provocation defences in particular play a normative roleThe Alberta case R v Tran explains why this question must have a normative dimension whereever it is asked. They endorse or condemn certain behaviours in recognition of the fact that these endorsements effect peoples behaviour.

If you look at the imposition on life and freedoms as a result of terrorism they really dont stack up.Theres also the issue that torture is probably an ineffective method of dealing with the broader issues. How does ripping peoples fingernails off stop terrorism from fomenting in the first place? Torture is a reactive measure in a best case scenario it is targeting events that are already in motion which IMO is already far too late.I think the main argument against torture is that it is less effective than other measures.Additionally if we are to address ethical concerns it isnt that you could be torturing innocent people its that you are normalising brutalising people. Your standards for treating suspects drop considerably to the point that you are prepared to kill them in the service of your goals.

Youre innocent you dont have any information to give. So they do rape them in front of you. Then they tell you that theyre going to start cutting parts off them in front of you if you dont answer their questions. Again youve got nothing to give them. So they start carving them up in front of you. Once it becomes obvious that theres no chance of any intelligence from you they kill you all because you are of no use to them anymore.Real torturers dont fuck around theyre experts in what they do which is break people psychologically through any means at their disposal. Its worth mentioning at this point that we only have a fraction of the evidence of the horrors that the US has put people through and well probably never get to see any of it because seeing minors degraded raped maimed and then shot in the head isnt exactly a PR win for the US. If the US really stood behind what it has done there wouldnt be any issue with releasing all the information on interrogation they have but they know that what theyve done is heinous and almost certainly war crimes so were never going to see that evidence.That is the claim but where is the evidence to support it?Can you be surprised when your enemies feel the same?

This situation would be further facilitated by the fact that the density of the universe is low in a heat death scenario as such it would be difficult for the machine to increase entropy via interactions with the environment.

However these theories hinge on an infinite time scale and the chance of a survivable universe reoccurring shortly with respect to the lifetime of the universe after the death of the old universe is negligible.

Medicine is not marketed by talking about what chemicals are in it relative to the competition rather they show clips of patients enjoying life while listing a crapload of deadly side effects. Yes it is true that many products are marketed by showing the viewer shots of a general lifestyle that does not really pertain to the product but the difference is that medicine is far more complicated and can do far more harm to a person if purchased hastily than something like gum or a coffee machine. Yes it is also true that doctors get the final say it is only with there perscription that a purchase of medication can be authorized so then I ask why do we need the commercial in the first place? Why not just send doctors a brochure of the latest in medication? There is also an arguement to be had for the vote with your dollar concept of capitalism but in my view medicine is exempt from this because no one wants to have to buy medicine and no one who is not a doctor is qualified to say which medication is better as well as the fact that most consumers are not going to try a variety and medicines and keep buying that which they like the best as is the case with shampoo or food.

This does not include better graphics on PC or Keyboardmouse support.By buying the game on one platform I have compensated the developer fully for all the work gone into making it buying another version that adds nothing to the previously bought version is just paying twice the price for one product solely because the rivalery of companies Sony Microsoft Nintendo prevents crossbuy. Expanding on my personal buying behaviour percent of the time I wouldnt have rebought the game anyway and am doing it purely for convenience bought on Xbox torrenting on laptop so I can play it when Im gone too so the developerconsolecompany wont make a loss on my illigal copy and the other of the time I might be interested in rebuying a game bought on console for PC for say the mods which are fully made by people outside the company and do so for no profit and I still might just have enjoyed the game enough to justify a rebuy if the price is right i.e. I enjoyed the first Fable game greatly on Xbox and bought Fable TLC in a Steam sale for so I could play it again with mouse keyboard and in widescreen. This port technically has some added content but is also the only version available on PC I wasnt interested in the extra content and could have done without would I have had the option. Therefore I wouldnt have felt guilty about torrenting it but at that price I have no issue considering the fun and time I put into it already. You could argue that in theory I could buy a console that a company has been selling at a loss in hopes of earning this back in sold games and pirate every single game on it as I already own them on another gaming machine therfore have the console company make a loss on me. I think thats a risk you take when youre selling your machine at a loss and if that business model doesnt work for you change it. Of course the odds of someone doing specifically this are very very low and is but a minor dent in the tenhundred thousands or even millions of consumers raking in the profits for these companies. I would be no more harm to them than a person buying the sole console only to let it eat dust in the basement not to mention the fact that I have a perfectly fine gaming laptop and wouldnt be buying their consoles anyway if it wasnt for their exclusives which as the name suggests are exclusive to that console. Along with that pirating a game on pc fully cuts out the machinedeveloper middle man and makes the loss go directly to the game developer.I think thats pretty much it I thought this up on the spot and read it over a few times but there might be some holes in it feel free to use those of course.

When people talk about rappers being deep I laugh most of the time. Especially if they cite Tupac. There are plenty of examples given from rappers who are very conscious and clever but even those hardly ever say anything I feel holds a candle to good lyrics from other genres. Comparing it to actual poetry I feel is a very immature argument and usually made by people who never read actual poetry. Also as someone who has played different musical instruments and rapped rapping at an elementary level was always much easier than playing an instrument. Singing takes years to learn well enough to do in public but most people can jot down some typical rap lyrics with ease and learn to recite them over a beat pretty easy. Case in point Eazy E became a famous rapper even touring the white house doing something he was terrible at. And rightfully so because you can be a terrible rapper and still sell a ton of records and actually be considered great at what you do and that does not apply to other forms of music.',\n",

It totally depends on the person as one or the other could come easier to them personally.Rapping doesnt require any tools instruments so anyone can pick it up and have a go with minimal effort. So there will inevitably be a lot of bad rappers. Some of these bad rappers become famous. I believe this is mainly due to the instrumentals music on the songs that make them famous. Meaning that the rapping isnt a very important factor in whether a song is popular or not. Of course a song with a good beat AND good rapping would be optimal but good beats can be enough to carry a rapper to fame. This does not mean that rapping is easier than playing an instrument it just means that as long as the rapper isnt absolutely terrible it does not matter as much as the music.This can also be true for other genres. There are plenty of non rap songs have terrible lyrics with good music and are loved by many. Does this mean that singing is easier than rapping or playing instruments?Also I disagree with your point that rap lyrics can never compare to other lyrics genres. What is it that you think makes singing words with melody rather than rapping words makes them any more or less significant or clever? In fact I would say the opposite in most cases as rapping allows for more room to articulate ideas as on average rap songs have more words than other genres.If you have not already I suggest you listen to Kendrick Lamars album Good Kid M.A.A.D City as an example of great lyricism and cohesion as a project. I have never listened to another album rap or not with lyrics that have impacted me as much as this. I believe that with infinite practice no one else on earth could recreate what Kendrick Lamar did with this album. If rapping was as easy as you say shouldnt anyone be able to do what Lamar has done?Rapping is essentially writing turned into sound.

Both portray their main characters as being born from poverty and progressing to riches only through disregard of their morals chasing money.

The next track Lifes a bitch goes further into this mentality Visualising the realism of life in actuality fuck whos the baddest a persons status depends on salary. Another classic hiphop song C.R.E.A.M. resigns to this fact as Gatsby does Cash rules everything around me.The racism aspect is also clear Face it Jerome get more time than Brandon and at the airport they check all through my bags and tell me its random but we stay winning This is also where the stereotypical hate for the police comes from. Nas in a song about the crushing poverty where he grew up Memory Lane says No sign of the beast in the blue Chrysler I guess that means peace.

Cornell University recognizes Hip Hop works as something worth studying and being available to scholars and the public. Additionally Harvard University began to take it seriously over years ago in when it started its HipHop Archive and Research Institute. Think about that Harvard a school synonymous with WASPs and privilege the first thing you may think of when it comes to an Ivy League school values Hip Hop so much they have a Research Institute and archive.A lot of other commenters are talking about the comparison youre making to the the glorification that Rock legends like Hendrix and The Stones have gotten. However consider that their heyday was the s and s whereas hip hop didnt really hit its stride until the early s. Id make a side point here that many early s genres are only just now getting major criticism recognition and thats often for artistsstyles that are effectively dead and gone re nirvana. Hip Hop however is still evolving changing and being mass produced by artists both good and bad. Still though Hip Hop today is still a very valid genre and theres a huge difference between Classic Hip Hop and much of the mainstream ilk out there. There have been classic Hip Hop and Rap artists awarded that kind of recognition for example Run DMC being inducted into the Rock N Roll Hall of Fame in And you have brought up Kaynes awards and critical fame hes been featured on the Rolling Stone cover twice and JayZ five times which I think essentially negates your own point Hip Hip is getting credit just maybe not in the way you think it deserves. End point scholars and musical critics alike note the influence and vastness of hip hop and its overall worth. That said not every artist out there today is amazing or worthy of drawing comparisons to classic literature just like many other genres that put out popular music. Critical recognition is very different from public recognition and Hip Hop has had a tough road in that respect with a lot of negative publicity due to past gang violence and now celebrity antics. No one though is arguing the worth of Hip Hop being less than any other musical genre out there though.'},\n",

Who are they discriminating against? White Males? As far as I know thats what the majority of the community is composed of.Secondly often times the content they highlight are offensive jokes and these statements are defended with statements like its just a joke. This makes the accusation that SRS is a hate group to me even stranger given that the vast majority of the comments in the comment section tend to be similar jokes just at the expense of those who mocked the disadvantagedor and assumed image of them. Can those who like making jokes at the expense of others not take what they dish out?Thirdly and probably most importantly SRS is in my view a very necessary force of balance. People like to say they are a force of censorship but I dont agree with that. First and foremost for all the complaints about brigading very few of the content they highlight is downvoted into obscurity. Beyond that Freedom of Speech is only guaranteed by the US Government but not by private companies like Reddit or massive populations like Reddits user base. Being downvoted isnt censorship. You expressed your sentiment and the community rejected it. Nothing was denied beyond validation. Reddit is an immensely useful medium and interface for connecting to people all over the world and it receives new users every day. When memes like Opinion Puffin basically degenerate into a way for people to seek validation for racist and sexist beliefs and this stuff gets upvoted to the front page from being on one of the sites most populated subs it can give the wrong idea as to what kind of community actually uses this site or give someone a good reason for not joining which is sad because social connection is exactly what Reddit was obviously designed to foster.Anyway those are my main reasons for my current position. Other stuff may come up in the discussion but this should be enough to at least get the ball rolling.

However I do not appreciate the redundancy of obvious filming tricks that seem to slip by others while I see them as cutcopy. I loathe actors. I think the acting paradigm is stale because of the way the movie industry operates recycling the same actors and suppressing the unique to guarantee another successful movie.Im also greatly disturbed by the way people rate movies. People never have an accurate critique on whether the movie was good or bad.

It is less about creative ability and much more about making money however that is an argument for another post. The argument that I have in response to your post is that as most movies become more generic in an attempt to pull in a more general audience and make more money more indie and less mainstream movies are easier to find and more important to the movie culture as a whole now. Movie fans are finding smaller more poignant films to view and discuss because they are so easy to seperate from the larger releases throughout the year and that is increasing the debate within movie culture.The way that people rate movies has becomes biased because the process of making a movie has become more widely known to the general audience as a whole. People understand how actors are cast how money is involved in decisionmaking and they are parting with more money at the cinema door than they were or years ago. They learn everything they can about an upcoming film before they make the trip to go and view it and part with their hard earned cash.To continue with the point in my first paragraph movie ratings are as mentioned before completely subjective to different members of the audience. They are never really absolute. They simply reflect a mixed level of feedback from a wide audience. Even seasoned movie critics people who watch and review films for a living basically often disagree on key points regarding a film. They take different things from different aspects of the film.Movie culture today faces more of a challenge in finding diversity or identifying a film that truly achieves something new or unique. You are right that diversity and creativity are less likely but you are wrong in thinking that this will deter movie fans. People who enjoy films will always want to watch films discuss them and debate on the finer points. It isnt overrated if you enjoy what youre doing.

       "  'arguments': 'So as an American sortatransplant to Canada and a law nerd I get a decent amount of flak for my very American views on civil rights laws.Specifically I am a really big fan of superstrong free speech and free press laws as well as really strong due process rights and am very critical of many Canadian legal institutions which dont seem to respect these.The biggest problem I have is with the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms and specifically with Section and Section .Section readsSection readsThese two and particularly Section gut the charter of any meaningful protection for civil liberties in Canada.Section has been used to fine people for handing out political pamphlets. It has been used to deny people freedom to travel. It has been used to establish quasi judicial bodies which do not have due process of law.Section called the notwithstanding clause lets the government exempt any law from the Charter on its own sayso. Quebec used this to implement incredibly strong restrictions on speech in languages other than French.The Oakes test used by Canadian courts to determine if a violation of constitutional rights under Section can be permitted is incredibly weak.Under Oakes the government must show that . The infringement is rationally related to a government objective.. The impairment of rights has to be as little as is reasonably possible and this one keeps creeping up used to be minimal impairment.. There must be proportionality between the infringement and the objective.In contrast in the US a restriction on free speech like in the Whatcott case above would be subject to strict scrutiny To meet the strict scrutiny standard the restriction must. Be justified by a compelling government interest. The reason for the restriction has to be something the government has to do not merely something they want to do.. Be narrowly tailored to that interest. That is the restriction must be very specific to the exact thing the government must do.. Be the least restrictive means possible to achieve the compelling government interest. That means if there is any other way to accomplish the goal it must be done before abridging the constitutional right in question.The Supreme Court of the US took on a case of much more hateful antigay speech than the Whatcott case right around the same time. That opinion sums up the US attitude to speech pretty wellspeech on public issues to ensure that we do not stifle public debate.

       "  'counters': 'As a Canadian law student Id like to try and shed some light on what I think are the distinct advantages of the Canadian Charter.It is true that the Charter is a weak tool for protecting some forms of speech. But if you look at the case law youll find a bit more nuance than your somewhat selective reading indicates. First and most importantly The Constitution in both Canada and the US is not a written document it is what the courts say it is. This is not in practice a license for judicial tyranny and it means that s. does not gut the Charter. In practice the governemtn frequently does not meet the s. standard.Speech Rights The court has adopted several specific tests for s. and s. analysis about speech rights. They arent important. What is important is the content of those tests. In R v Keegstra the court adopted a purposive approach to speech rights. They identified the purpose of the s. protections as being the free flow of ideas something democratic and something about selfactualisation I dont remember the exact words. Certain forms of speech that undermine these values e.g. threats some instances of hate speech especially if said by a public figure are granted diminished protections. You may disagree with this but the important part is that the vast majority of speech is offered much higher degree of protection in practice. This is why Commercial speech is difficult to restrict. A law preventing the hanging of signs was held not to prevent someone hanging a sign that denounced a local business as dishonest. Tobacco advertising restrictions were weakened after a couple a sequential cases. The right to picket has usually been upheld under speech protections as have a number of speech acts Political speech news media and art are difficult to restrict. An ambient noisenuisance law used to fine a strip club in Montreal was shut down. Laws preventing individuals from campaigning have been narrowed or struck.s. I dont think speech rights are the most important and certainly arent the only rights protected by the Charter. It also includes s. the right to life liberty and security of the person and the right not to be deprived thereof except in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice. The important thing about s. is that no law found violating s. has ever been upheld under s. . Thats pretty effective. This is why that tribunal you linked to actually has limited powers a wide array of punishments are tied to certain aspects of due process. Other Rights I dont know much about the freedom of movement but the case you linked to seems like a pretty narrow and specific restriction which is all s. was designed to permit. s. has also been a consistently effective guarantor of religious rights. Trinity Western Teaching College was in spite of its frankly offensive policies towards gays in particular was not denied accreditation or public funding bc of s. it also explicitly guarantees the rights of religious schools. The Charter has been used to strike laws restricting sex work language rights and a wide variety of abusive police tactics.Clarity and Flexibility All constitutions are AFAIK flexible when it comes to fundamental rights. The US Charter doesnt identify any standard of scrutiny a fairly elaborate body of jurisprudence needed to be developed to accommodate the realities of governance. The Canadian Charter is much clearer more realistic less divisive and more usable because of this. It is embodies language that allows it to be developed by the courts within certain limits over time e.g. s. . This is important bc constitutions inevitably change over time and when there are no textual limits on that change you arrive at a situation like what exists in teh US where the Constitution enforced by the courts bears little resemblance to the Constitution as written its really interesting to note the universally acknowledged importance of intentbased interpretation of the Constitution in Canada. In the US thats a very controversial doctrine. The flexibility of the Charter means it will not break i.e. be ignored or interpreted out of existence.Positive Rights The Canadian Charter recognises in several places the importance of positive rights in a way that the American Constitution does not. Im thinking in particular of s. which says Subsection does not preclude any law program or activity that has as its object the amelioration of conditions of disadvantaged individuals. It also explicitly guarantees a right to legal counsel and a number of language rights. And perhaps most importantly enshrines a de facto duty to accommodate on the government equal Benefit of the law etc... in a way that the Constitution of the US does not. Canada also has a statutory bill of rights that has been recognised as quasiconstitutional remember what I said above about judicial constructivism?. This serves to protect a variety of property rights which are neglected by the Charter and supplement the antdiscriminatory protections. The Charter is more effective in addressing your concerns than you think. It is also very good at protecting those things that are most important life liberty process rights. It is also much more realistic than the US constitution by acknowledging the need to protect certain positive rights. Frankly s. is extremely similar to Strict Scrutiny remember there are a whole bunch of crucial rights in the US including due process and property related rights that receive one of two lower standards of scrutiny. Be justified by a compelling government interest. The reason for the restriction has to be something the government has to do not merely something they want to do.The Oakes test requires a compelling and substantial purpose theyre very similar. Be narrowly tailored to that interest. That is the restriction must be very specific to the exact thing the government must do.The Oakes test does the same thing either by requiring a rational connection between meanseffects and the purpose preventing nonspecific restrictions and by a general requirement of proportionality. Be the least restrictive means possible to achieve the compelling government interest. That means if there is any other way to accomplish the goal it must be done before abridging the constitutional right in question.This is just part of the Oakes test.TLDR TO THE EDIT AMERICA USES A RATIONAL BASIS REVIEW FOR SOME QUESTIONS OF DUE PROCESS. CANADA DOES NOT. CANADA BASICALLY APPLIES STRICT SCRUTINY BY ANOTHER NAME TO EVERYTHING THE US DOES NOT.'},\n",

I like many people and Im guessing you as well feel that standardized testing is a waste when students could be learning far more useful skills and applying far more of their talents and abilities. HOWEVER the science on IQ testing is really well established standardized tests correlate very well with IQ tests and also with later educational achievement and also with later success in careers higher incomes in adult life etc. Standardized tests are very predictive almost scarily predictive. Theres an element to IQ testing known as the g factor What it is is a kind of abstraction that correlates all of the features of various IQ tests memory recognition speed problem solving logical analysis etc.. Cognitive researchers hypothesize that it represents some general mental ability... perhaps something like mental energy perhaps a general ability to focus. They arent really sure what it is. But what they are sure of is that the g factor is quite predictive the correlation between IQ and grades and achievement scores is between . and .. At more advanced educational levels more students from the lower end of the IQ distribution drop out which restricts the range of IQs and results in lower validity coefficients. In high school college and graduate school the validity coefficients are .. .. and .. respectively According to research by Robert L. Thorndike to percent of the predictable variance in scholastic performance is due to g with the rest attributed to nong factors measured by IQ and other tests. Research suggests that the SAT widely used in college admissions is primarily a measure of g. A correlation of . has been found between g scores computed from an IQ test battery and SAT scores. There is a high correlation of . to . between the prestige rankings of occupations as rated by the general population and the average general intelligence scores of people employed in each occupation. At the level of individual employees the association between job prestige and g is lower one large U.S. study reported a correlation of . . corrected for attenuation. The correlation between income and g as measured by IQ scores averages about . across studies. The correlation is higher at higher levels of education and it increases with age stabilizing when people reach their highest career potential in middle age. Even when education occupation and socioeconomic background are held constant the correlation does not vanish. The g factor is reflected in many social outcomes. Many social behavior problems such as dropping out of school chronic welfare dependency accident proneness and crime are negatively correlated with g independent of social class of origin. Health and mortality outcomes are also linked to g with higher childhood test scores predicting better health and mortality outcomes in adulthood. TLDR If you do well on standardized aptitudeachievement tests youre at least more likely to make higher than average grades to likely to do well on the SAT more likely to become a doctor attorney or business executive or similar highprestige profession about more likely to earn a higher income and much less likely to have social behavior problems.

If you and society around you swear a lot from the minor inconveniences what language would you use if you experienced tremendous injustice and felt significant rage and inner pain?Whats this have to do with kids? We want to encourage kids to have an expansive vocabulary so that they can adequately express themselves and convey their thoughts and feelings.

When sales wasnt the focus the corporate side of the organization seemed disinterested in support for campinghiking trips adult leaders needed many certifications before you could do these activities or anything that didnt involve pushing for higher numbers during the next sales drive. This wasnt as much the case in Boy Scouts but it was certainly becoming more a focus than in years past. It seems to me that what once was a strictly volunteer organization with few full time organizers has become a very big corporate entity as of the s which has lost focus on child development and put more of it on profiteering off of the very children they are meant to inspire. I want to stress that since a large corporate structure was essentially unnecessary and then a shift happened as of the s which began a massive change in both organizations from the top. I understand the need for a national organization to make sure that standards are met materials such as books and badges are produced and camps are managed. I just think that was once managed by relatively small numbers of individuals whos salaries were likely below K a year have been replaced with a large corporation with salaries that are hidden but most certainly well above K annually and who enjoy an extra cozy and sheltered status with the government.I could be wrong.

The truth is that most people when thinking of what is right and wrong do not decide on ethical principles and then reason outwards from those principles. Rather they learn which behaviours are and arent acceptable through social interaction and any intellectual engagement with morality is merely finding reasons justifying their moralperceptual status quo. This is philosophy reduced to mere rationalisation.We can see moral pioneers in people like Bentham and Mill both of whom anticipated relatively modern moral concerns such as womens equality under the law animal welfare and the thencontemporary issue of slavery. These people came to egalitarian conclusions at least one hundred years before feminism and the animal liberation movement.There exists a continuum of moral agency with those moral visionaries being a small portion of the population the average person as the majority obviously and another minority of people constitutionally incapable of moral agency the severely mentally disabled infants perhaps psychopaths.So what would a good person look like?.

They would act only in accord with that which would or that which generally would bring the actual state of affairs closer to the ideal state of affairs.This describes very few people.

This results in a net negative in effective justice because less officers means more crime. . It will create an upward trend in the riskreward mentality. Due to their scarcity cops will eventually lead to higher compensations to incentivize the fields. This is something present in other fields already where scarcity for the position exists such as medical nurses having large signing bonuses. This leads to increased police spending for less officers once again creating a net negative for justice.. The proposed things Ive heard such as maiming instead of killing and body cams provide proper closure for a negligible amount of cases but create far more gaps in coverage than they are worth. So its logically inconsistent to say Make cops more accountable so we can have more true justice. Raising the liability of police officers and destroying police coverage because of this ideology is not a positive boon to the justice system. Yes more high profile cases are covered better but their frequency is too infrequent to justify the loss of police force. At which point if you insist on some of the measures suggested you are not for more justice you are just cop hating.Please .',\n",

       "  'arguments': 'Everyone whether they are being truthful or not knows the consequences of accusing someone else of a crime. You know that they will probably be charged and you know the order of magnitude of punishment they will receive.Take a scenario where you knowingly wrongfully accuse someone of murder and they get the death penalty as a result. I would say that you murdered this person and therefore should be exposed to the death penalty yourself in trial. This seems to especially apply in cases of rape. While there are no doubt actual rapes that do occur. False accusations of rape have been used as a tool to destroy the lives of others going all the way back to the Jim Crow South where black men were hung on frivolous rape accusations.This tradition continues today with cases like the University of Virginia and this is what I believe and not the subject of this post Bill Cosby. A person making a legitimate accusation has nothing to fear but people would think twice before wrongfully accusing others.I have predicted the generic responses to my argument and will respond to them here.Rightful accusers would have something to fear if the person who victimized them gets away with their crime they will now face prosectionThis is a good point but I think that this can be solved by rethinking the way we choose juries. Jury selection in this country is effectively a rigged process regardless of the location of the trial the makeup of juries is almost always a homogeneous group of white suburbanites with predictable opinions. This makes it very difficult to convict criminal archetypes like the college rapist or the malpracticing doctor. By introducing higher racial and socioeconomic diversity into juries we can eliminate the predictability of verdicts.The punishment is harsher than the crime.No it isnt. Killing someone is no different than setting a machine in motion that will result in them dying. Tricking the government into locking someone away for years is surely a capital offense and should be punished as such.The perjury charge handles thisI believe that this is too weak it is not a capital offense and it should be.I am willing to change this view but it will take some level of convincing. I am eager to hear the responses. MODIFICATION OF MY VIEW credit to uAMereRedditorI now believe that the minimum sentence for the crime that the accuser was accused of is inappropriate but that the maximum sentence for the attempted version of the same crime is still very much appropriate. If you are found guilty of knowingly wrongfully accusing someone of murder your sentence should be the maximum for attempted murder',\n",

       "  'arguments': 'My argument may come of as pretentious but I will do my best to present my view in a valid and logical way.Everyone is entitled to their opinion. It is a phrase all of us have used or heard most likely within the past few days. It is a phrase built to end arguments prevent yelling and provide a middle ground for those who simply can not agree. There are many cases that the phrase can be used for its intended purpose and remain harmless. One such case an argument is based SOLELY on opinion such as preference to chocolate or vanilla hot or cold red or blue. Another case is when an argument has continued through all other types of context and discourse that it has simply boiled down to a difference of opinion often dealing with some sort of sensory informationfeel taste smell etc.. Unfortunately the use of everyone is entitled to their opinion has shifted over time and is more often than not used in a visceral and spiteful manner. That is when the phrase becomes dangerous. The thought process behind the spiteful and lazy use of that phrase is what allowed cultures speaking mostly of the US because that is where I am from to slide away from a collective and productive entity and into a state of cyclical banter. My evidence of the danger of the phrase and the effect it has had on the culture is as follows . People use the phrase to lazily get out of arguments that are difficult or are in a field that they are not familiar with. They use the phrase to cover up their ignorance in order to protect their misconstrued beliefs. They will argue in circles for hours about something they dont know and justify the entire waste of brainpower as an opinion difference in order to move on with their lives without fracturing their beliefs. . The idea of being an expert on a topic is no longer valid. It is no longer valid because bits and pieces of info are so readily available individuals will allow themselves to feel they have enough information to form a strong belief without being an expert on the topic. The invaluable amount of time true experts spend in their fields hours according to the fantastic book Outliers by Malcolm Gladwell is nullified by the amount of perceived expertise that is part of our current cultural climate. . Factual arguments that can be argued down to a relative truth within the context of the argument are no longer explored. Opinions are seen as facts that are carelessly spewed from various newspropaganda organizations. The Everyone is entitled to their opinion mindset is the engine that drives the divide in cultural beliefs. No suitable and rational arguments are being made anymore because an OPINION is something that doesnt need to be changed as everyone is entitled to have one. There are many more examples that I will go into if needed. Essentially what I am saying is that the idea behind the phrase and the misuse of the phrase is an underlying cause of many of the political cultural and social issues that continue to exist year after yearwith many of them getting worse. The idea that everyone has an entitlement when it comes to opinions that affect beliefs is preposterous and dangerous.

One possibility as to why you have this opinion is because everything is documented today. The internet and a globally connected society has allowed us to keep track of what is going on in a lot of the world. Compare this to the past where what you stayed informed on was largely limited to what had an impact on your daily life. Furthermore negative and destructive events tend to be documented more simply because they make for better news. Finally I sincerely doubt we will completely eradicate ourselves through our own actions. We have segments of our society scientists investigating global warming or overpopulation that have recognized what could happen and when it becomes more obvious to the rest of the general population humanity as a whole will take steps to account for it. In regards to your belief with other sentient life my points on humanity are relevant if you believe the issues we face today are not unique to us. In terms of coming across other sentient life we have only recently been able to somewhat observe planets that could support life. Our current understanding of physics indicates it would be prohibitively difficult to visit planets outside of our solar system unless we think on an extremely long timescale. The same would hold for other sentient life attempting to reach us. Furthermore I dont really understand your two minds concept. Many individuals who seek power and greed are very intelligent. It seems to me like you were thinking along the lines of selfless and selfish those interested in society as a whole and those interested in solely themselves.

       "  'arguments': 'To elaborate I was in an argument over at rlibertarian over a quote from Ron Paul that was getting a lot of flak. I think that institutions and political efforts that act for the benefit of a specific race or for the promotion of so called diversity are inherently racist and reinforcing the problem. I understand what institutionalized racism is and how our cultures stereotypes can make it difficult for people of certain backgrounds to change the stereotypes in the first place i.e. a selffulfilling prophecyYet I agree with Ron Paul in that ending these stereotypes is not a matter of actively promoting diversity or mandating changes to our system. Instead I believe that we have to provide absolutely equal opportunities to everyone regardless of race stop asking for it in the paperwork and stop teaching the racial stereotypes to our youth. In short I think we have to stop caring about race to stop caring about race.It seems that any opinion I hold is discounted by my race because I cant possibly understand the struggles of minorities which I find quite ironic as white is a minority in my town. This fact seems to distract every argument and I never get a reasonable response so please !',\n",

Maybe then it would finally be okay to stop talking about race.But I think people underestimate or dont even realize just how much else would need to be changed for that kind of world to be justified.Right now one of the main criticisms of white people not wanting to talk about racism because they dont see race or theyre colorblind is that white people get to enjoy being seen as the default. So if no ones talking about race its their culture thats being taken for granted as normal. Its their culture that gets to be upheld and appreciated if no ones mentioning anything about race.So in the hypothetical utopia where its become okay to stop talking about race now that default status would also have to vanish. If we want other races to no longer need any special promotion or defense our culture would instead have to take for granted that theres all types of traditions and backgrounds people could come from which would all be seen as normal and valid without people batting an eyelash at how novel or exotic they are.Someone rocking up to work in an outfit wed call ethnic would need to be seen as equally professional as a suit. Someone speaking a different language in public or having multilingual signage in a store would need to no longer be criticized for not assimilating. Movies or video games or any other media with the most prominent characters or themes coming from a different race would need to be seen as just another blockbuster or bestseller that whites would pay to experience just as widely and readily as minorities now consume the mostlywhite mainstream media all around them.Basically in this world white culture and white status and white representation would no longer be as widespread or special. So when white people today complain about any other race trying to get some more representation or they fear that some other way of doing things could become more normalized and threaten their hold on the definition of normality... it suggests to me that white people dont actually envision this type of world when they say they want to stop talking about race.It sounds more like they just want to stay on top and for everyone else to shut up.Thats why racism will only end once we stop talking about race is a statement that should be met with the utmost skepticism.'},\n",

       "  'arguments': 'I know this is a widely hated view in the gay community however I just cant help seeing the truth in it. So I am a firm believer in cultural relativism that you can not judge a culture base off of morals or societal norms you gained from your own culture. So we have example one that being gay is okay because we have seen it throughout history in many different cultures the Greeks being a prime example. However they also were constant offenders of pedophilia forcing twelve year old boys to give oral sex to grown men. We bring up pacific island cultures that idolize drag queens and transgenders however there are also cultures where the women teach the year old boys how to have sex. How can the first be okay but not the second. They are both acceptable in their respective cultures just one is deemed disgusting in our culture. We bring up animals point out how so many different species have gay relationships but animals also start having sex as soon as they are able to produce babies which is like twelve for us. Being gay is natural being a pedophile is natural we see both through out history and across species lines. Neither are the norm but are widely accepted in many cultures. However westernized cultures have deemed sex with children to be wrong. I ask a westerner what they think about pedophilia they say its disgusting. Its the same when I ask a homophobic Christians what they think about gay people they say its disgusting. Both are view points that have been instilled in those people through their culture. Since it is widely accepted that pedophilia is bad I feel like the gay community gets defensive and tries to distant themselves for pedophilia when in truth they are very much alike. Before I get all the messages of being homophobic or being a child molester I figured Id state my views. I am in full support of the gay community I have a gay sister that I love very dearly. I am in noway condoning or promoting pedophilia I too find it disgusting and wrong but understand that that viewpoint is a product of the society I grew up in.

Youre somewhat correct in saying theres nothing objectively different between the two neither are particularly harmful in cultures where they are accepted.

We also that believe that humans have restricted rights to selfdetermination until their midtolate teens. Gay sex used to be taboo in the west but things have changed without any harm to society or individuals. In order for things to change for pedophilia we would either have to remove the requirement for sexual consent or allow children the right to self determine as adults. This would be harmful to children because they could easily be talked into harmful sexual acts unfair contracts or all of the other social acts theyre not fully prepared for.'},\n",

       "  'titles': 'Refusing to presumptively believe an accuser of rape or any other crime is a NOT equivalent to presumptively disbelieving her and b the proper course to take in the absence of further evidence.',\n",
       "  'arguments': 'Advance apologies for the length and possibly the perceived tone of this post for which I beg your indulgence. I tried to explain my position as clearly as I could and in cases like that my writing tends to take a decidedly formal swerve. Im aware that this carefully formal style may make me sound smug pompous or whatever other adjectives of oblivious selfinflation may apply. If anything I write strikes you that way Im sorry. I only ask you to keep in mind that it probably stems from love of precision and perhaps poor judgment of tone rather than from condescension.BackgroundThis topic is on my mind because its apparently been raised again recently in an episode of Aaron Sorkins The Newsroom and I just read in todays New York Times an article about the controversy that episode aroused It seems the episode involved a credible empathetic accuser and a sketchy offscreen accused so that the viewer automatically tends to give her story credence. Even so a journalist in the episode argues that it is unethical to publically accuse the man in front of a television audience without any conviction or trial.This seems to have aroused a huge backlash with articles published on Jezebel and elsewhere accusing Aaron Sorkin of choosing to victimblame a woman who was rapeddespite the fact that as Sorkin points out in a later quotation in the article he created this character to be a sympathetic alleged rape victim whose story has been neither corroborated nor disproved.Another quotation from the NYT articlePresentation of my viewsIt seems to me that in discussions of this sort people persistently conflate not believing ones story with disbelieving ones story as if there were no option other than believing in one thing or the oppositebut this distorts the basic fact that in a world where perfect truth is unattainable NOT believing in something is distinct from DISbelieving it. When two people dispute something and I dont have a good reason to believe one or the other my default position is not to presumptively believe either until the introduction of further evidence. This is a commonplace in most areas of human life but when the subject in dispute is whether A raped B it seems less and less to be taken for granted.Moreover I believe that it is extremely difficult to come up with credible statistics about how likely uncorroborated accusations are to be true for the simple reason that one is inherently dealing with disputed uncorroborated things and is very liable to fall into circular reasoning or a similar lapse in rendering the all important question of how to categorize a given accusation for purposes of his study. For this reason I mentally have grave reservations every time I read a number purporting to say what percentage of rape accusations are true or false.Furthermore even if for arguments sake one granted that the vast majority of rape accusations were true I still believe that due process as we think of it with regard to criminal accusations of any sortviz. innocent until proven guiltywould remain vitally important because its abrogation in any case would warp the incentive structures embedded in our society. It would be a very dangerous thing to create a system that provides an avenue for a false accuser to disastrously affect someone elses life while facing little or no potential negative impact him or herself.Summary of my viewsThe views Im asking you to change if you can are. It is extremely difficult if not impossible to know with any accuracy what percentage of rape accusations are true or false. Therefore assumptions of this nature should be given very limited credibility in the broader discussion of how to deal with a rape accusation.. The protocol of innocent until proven guilty is important NOT as a method of determining actual truth how could it be? but as a way to avoid creating societal systems that can be manipulated and abused by false accusers. As such it should be adhered to whenever departing from it would create a loophole for such abuse.. A common and misleading rhetorical tactic frequently used by advocates of strengthening laws and other societal devices intended to discourage andor punish rape is to frame the issue as if the only two possibilities are for us to presumptively believe one side or the other. This ignores the third most important possibility of all which is not to take a presumptive position in the absence of corroborating evidence. The false assumption that one must begin by taking a presumptive position distorts the practical issues at hand to the point of making reasonable discussion on them impossible while that assumption remains unchallenged.My biasesI should mention for the record that I have a tendency to think about things in the abstract rather than relating to them strongly on an emotional level an INTP personality type if you like the MyersBriggs categorization system Furthermore Im a man and do not personally know any rape victims that Im aware of so to the extent that I do relate to these things on an emotional level which of course I do too I feel more strongly the plight of the hypothetical innocent man facing a false accusation the position I can more readily imagine myself in than the hypothetical violated woman seeking justice.Im aware of both these biases and of course like everything else in our world of matter and men my views are also subject to Newtons First Law which states that to alter them requires a force equivalent to that with which they were previously held.And so...with those caveats in mind change my views please if you will any or all of them. Even if you dont succeed in changing them entirely Ill welcome any added perspective you can provide me and I believe Im open to that much at the very least.PS Support rolesA number of people in this thread have drawn a distinction between the roles of ideally neutral public figures like law officers and journalists and the roles of a persons support system immediate family and close friends suggesting that public stances in cases like this should be neutral but private stances should be unreservedly supportive. Id tentatively agree with that with the proviso that Id apply it equally to close friends of either potential victim of rape or of slander. Id add that I feel people should be generally freer to rely on their individual judgment in deciding what to believe when theyre not acting on those beliefs in a way thats liable to directly cause harm to someone else.',\n",
       "  'counters': 'This is my fundamental issue with your argument. While in real life truth is not black and white believing someone is. Do you really think that the victim of a trauma rape is going to hear you saying I dont believe you but I also dont DISbelieve you and walk away feeling like he or she was heard and understood? I doubt it. I wouldnt. If you dont believe someone then you disbelieve them. Imagine a victim of another emotional and hard to prove crime. Imagine someone came to you and said Someone is stalking me. They keep calling and when I answer the phone they are breathing into it heavily or they just hang up. I hear tapping on my window at night. Ive set up a surveillance camera and I cant catch them on tape. While that story could be proven to be a lie its unlikely that you would say to your friend who is freaked out and confiding in you I hear your story and Im just going to wait until you have some evidence to really believe you. While that may be the logical sensical way to respond to it that does nothing to ease the emotional damage that has been done. Youre essentially saying I dont really believe you to someone who is in a highly emotional state.I dont disagree that rapes accusations should not be made in public unless there is hard evidence. If someones name is going to go on the record if its going to affect their life then those accused of rape deserve to have evidence presented against them not just someones word. But in the rape debate I feel like people forget that being accused of any crime ruins someones life. Think about people who are accused of child abuse murder even theft. If your employer gets wind that youre the prime suspect in a murder investigation you bet your ass there are going to be consequences. So your argument isnt necessarily about rape its about an accusation of crime at all. No one is innocent until proven guilty. For an extreme example look at OJ or Casey Anthony. Stop by rserialpodcast and check out the debates people get in over a man who was convicted of murder years ago. I would say that grey area is just an inherent part of our legal system. To tip my hand a little I am a woman in her late s who was sexually assaulted in college. I knew my assailant I worked with him and my assault was one of those messy instances where as a victim I didnt do the right thing. I was drinking underage I trusted someone that others perceived as shady I was very friendly and kind to him which gave him the wrong idea. I know in my heart that I was assaulted. I had to quit my job because when he inevitably got fired everyone in my workplace blamed me started rumors about my sexual activity and allaround implied or sometimes said outright that I was lying. My sexual history is the sole reason I did not go to the police. I knew that if I was going to be put on trial so to speak at my place of employment then an investigation would just dig up all of the skeletons that I hid away for a reason. I told that story because the socialcultural pressures and forces that surround rape cases are a major part of why women push for every rape accuser to be believed immediately. Because it is so easy to brush rape off to read a radical feminists post on tumblr about how all sex is rape and internalize the fact that if women really wanted to they could avoid most rapey situations. Yes I personally could have done things to avoid my rape. I made bad choices. But does that make my assailants decision to rape me any less bad? In our publics eyes it comes off that way. When we can avoid putting the victims life on trial when we can as a society view rape for what it is an act of power and aggression not sexual desire I think we can move forward and have a more easily received conversation about false rape accusations. But our culture and national conversation stands and you cant ignore that piece of it in my mind.'},\n",

I dont believe this to be true.I dont believe that it is the power that corrupts people but the fact that people themselves are corrupt to begin with and that obtaining a position of power just offers them a medium through which to act on their corruption. I do believe that the majority of people are in fact corrupt. So assuming you take a random person and insert them into a position of power it is likely that they will abuse the power that is granted to them. But I also believe if you take a person who isnt corrupt and insert them into this same position of power they will not abuse the privileges and power of the position that is granted to them.I think teachers illustrate this point very well especially because it is much easier to become a teacher than say the President of the United States. In this regard you tend to have a larger sample size and have many more types of people to consider. In most cases I would say that teachers tend to have absolute power over their classes at least with regards to daytoday activities. Generally if a teacher says to do something it is expected that the student comply to the demand of the teacher. If the student disagrees typically the matter is resolved at a later date with the intervention of a teachers superior.Taking this assumption that teachers have absolute power over their students you still tend to find a balance of teachers who abuse their power and those who dont. If the saying that absolute power corrupts absolutely were true all teachers would abuse their power since it is the power that corrupts the person and not the person that corrupts the power.Parents work well for this example as well. Literally anybody can become a parent as having a child is as easy as having sex. I would even say that parents definitely have absolute power over their children even moreso than teachers. But even with parenting you still tend to find a balance. Some parents are incredibly strict and unfair dictating arbitrary rules for their children that they themselves may not follow or rules that have no legitimate reason other than because I say so. Im not arguing the fact that sometimes parents use the because I say so justification even if the rule does have a legitimate reason but sometimes parents dont actually have a reason other than I say so. However you also find parents that are incredibly fair with their children. If a child does not agree with a rule set by a parent and argues his or her case fairly there are parents that would reconsider and change their rule for the sake of being fair. If absolute power corrupts absolutely parents like the latter would not exist as the power they hold over their child would corrupt them.TLDR Absolute power does not corrupt absolutely absolute corruption corrupts power absolutely.',\n",

People who are supposed to stand for the general public not a couple corporations. Additionally we all know Obama is pro neutrality. I have no opinion on Obama or his work. Maybe I will after he finishes this term. But I see people opposing net neutrality SOLELY because Obama is for it. What? Youre willing to limit one of the greatest inventions for technological growth in the last century just because the other party doesnt want to limit it? You have no basis to your argument its just that Obama is for it. And apparently he is never morally right ? How can voters trust your party if you just go against another persons beliefs just because of who they are? If this whole ordeal repeatedly continues into other issues that we face in the future what does this mean for the citizens? It would effectively be run by whoever has more people in power and those people have a chance of being run by money sent to them by corporations. Additionally I often see that we are left with the choice of dumb vs dumber in elections. Why are the parties in charge of who represents them? Cant we eliminate the parties and each candidate stands by his own beliefs not the partys and then we can elect someone the majority agrees with? .',\n",
       "  'counters': 'Ill argue on your point that the U.S. government has devolved in this mentality.The U.S. government system is like this by design. The two major parties of each era have always been at odds with each other. From the Founders intent perspective we get this line from the Federalist Papers ambition versus ambition. The Founders envisioned an inherently adversarial system of governance as opposed to the unilateral monarchical rule that they were accustomed to. Sudden arbitrary unilateral change was the enemy to them. Their objective was for any substantial change to be gradual going across multiple election cycles.For a breakdown of the mechanics of how they achieved this CGPGrey did an excellent analysis of why third parties cant win which by necessity breaks down how the U.S. election system works dont have the link handy. Ill summarize by simply pointing out that at the national level our representatives can seem uncompromising because of the closed primary system which they must navigate to secure their nominations for a particular position. This is why youll often see presidential candidates flipflop going into the general election after they get their partys nomination they have to posture themselves to two completely different demographics.Im not saying this is a justification but its important to understand that there are systemic reasons for the state of U.S. politics.Now the psychology of politics is something youve gotta consider. Your proposition to do away with parties entirely is if not unwise at least impractical. The tendency towards to selfselection and group mentalities means that parties will inevitably pop up. The best we can do would perhaps be to rework our election system so that alternative parties are more viable. You also shouldnt underestimate the degree to which voters use party identification as a cognitive shortcut. This phenomenon is so powerful that I would recommend the polar opposite of your preference with a proportional voting system where people vote for their preferred party and seats within the legislature are distributed according to the proportion of votes for each party.Parties are also useful because they provide cognitive shortcuts for representatives as well. By that I mean that each party can have a common platform for each policy area while individual members can specialize in particular policy areas and have strong beliefs and values on the issues they or their constituents care about while being rank and file supporters for their partys general policy agenda.Now as far as the specific policy issue of net neutrality I would like to point out that there are legitimate criticisms of the current proposal that are compelling in light of the postSnowden era. Of course that doesnt change the fact that the prominent Republican criticisms of it rely on ad hominem arguments to oppose legitimately problematic policies that they would in all actuality probably be okay with if their guy was in the White House. Ever since weve seen this kind of political posturing against the Obama administration and while that campaign has been intellectually dishonest and very damaging in some ways its important to acknowledge and respect this persistent proportion of Americans who are genuinely not okay with the direction that the country is going. While the individual arguments they may articulate on any given issue can come across as fallacious theres an underlying cognitive shortcut in their opposition that stems from the fact that they disagree with the principles that President Obama and the Democratic Party use to justify their policies. RE big government v. small government military policy aside. The antiObama coalition within Congress and the media is really just the disadvantaged side in the current political climate trying to gain leverage against the majority its an intellectually dishonest strategy but a concise strategy nonetheless.This goes somewhat with what the Founders meant by the tyranny of the majority. Just as a nation should not be unilaterally ruled by a king it should also not be ruled by a simple majority of people. The solution they proposed was that every major policy be a compromise where neither side really gets what they want. But when were not left with the situation where someone can be considered threefifths of a person our simplemajority election system sometimes results in one side getting everything they want while the other dont get anything and that can breed a lot of hatred and frustration in people.'},\n",

The reason econ gets a lot of flack has more to do with public perception and general economic misunderstand than it does with economics being empirical. Macro in particular gets most of the scrutiny since it moreorless affects the most people. The go to comparison for macro is often meteorology because they both suffer from a lot of the same problems inability to do large scale experimentation incredibly high about of variables etc. This is reflected in their fields inability to often accurately predict the future its just that the weather man being wrong doesnt have quite the same adverse effects. There are many other areas of the physical sciences that run into similar problems.There is disagreement in the field but its more so for questions of what we ought to do rather than what the results of a particular policy will be. What we ought to do is dependent on what we value and prioritize but what will happen isnt subject to that bias. Most people in general are terrible with economics a lot of common ideas can be pretty unintuitive for the laymen. You know how rarely Democrats and Republicans agree economically?

I can tell you that despite the added complexity of the subjects of psychological study human minds and human culture are much more complex than elementary particles! the methods used are very similar to those used in the physical sciences. There are obviously some studies that are more rigorous than others but that is true in every scientific field. The nice thing about psychology in particular is that over the past couple years there has been a huge surge of discussion around how to increase the rigour of our research. There is an increasing push for open science making our data and materials freely accessible preregistering our hypotheses to avoid afterthefact rationalizations and so on. Plenty of efforts are underway and on some of these issues psychology is at the forefront of scientific fields in addressing them though I am envious of physics with their arXiv.org!.When you contrast Steven Pinker with men are from Mars you are comparing apples and oranges. Pinker is a respected scientist men are from Mars was written by a guy who got his degree from an unaccredited and now defunct school and has no real scientific training. That book and others like it are contradicted by years of painstaking research by real psychologists that study the dynamics of relationships and find that men and women have similar relationship needs.A lot of pop psych stuff out there is absolute garbage and its frustrating how difficult it can be to find good psych. information written at the level that the general public can easily understand. The best I can say is to do your research and try to find wellrespected sources. For example Thinking Fast and Slow by Daniel Kahneman is a popularlevel book but is written by a respected researcher and Nobel prizewinner who pioneered the field of behavioural economics. Stumbling on Happiness by Daniel Gilbert is also a great book by a great psychologist. Snoop by Sam Gosling The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat by Oliver Sacks and Influence Science and Practice by Robert Cialdini are also excellent reads that are still highly accessible to the lay public.

Ill concede that TFiOS is really overrated but I think Looking for Alaska and Paper Towns in particular are really solid because theyre a twist on the Manic Pixie Dream Girl thing thats really prolific in media right now. I think its really important to see books that show the female romantic lead to the introverted male protagonist as a flawed human and not just a collection of traits that change the life of the protagonist. It has been a trend in the industry for a really long time to just have very flat female characters and while maybe not the most mature or intelligent handling of the issue I respect it for being an attempt thats reaching a wide audience. There are other examples in media that are doing the same thing better like Days of Summer or Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind but as far as books reaching a wide preteen and teen audience I feel like John Green does a solid job at creating more multidimensional characters even if they can still come off as generic and tropey in their own ways.'},\n",

He sacrificed himself and died a good person albeit one who had done terrible things. People are not defined by their past at least not exclusively. They are also defined by their present what they are doing now and their future what they intend to do. And so the fact that vader did unforgivable things does not mean that vader couldnt end up being a good person again. However it does mean that vader had a debt to society that he could never come close to fully repaying. But having become a good person he did his best to repay that debt by sacrificing his life to save his son. I suppose the long and the short of it is forgivenessredemption. Vader could be redeemed without being forgiven. We know and vader knew that he couldnt make things right. But we also know that at least for the last minutes of his life vader would do anything in his power to right as many of those wrongs had he could. And thats why he died a good person.Lastly its worth noting that the force complicates this issue. In the real world its hard to imagine someone truly and honestly changing from serious evil to truly good at all let alone as rapidly as vader did. But the force can help us to explain vaders transition. The force specifically the dark side is like a drug. Only while most real world drugs merely make you stupid the dark side makes you evil. Evil people dont simply use the dark side the very use of the dark side makes them more evil creating this positive feedback loop of hate and anger and lust for power. Anakin is too blame for falling into this cycle just as a drunk driver is responsible for crashes when drunk. Lets run with this analogy. A drunk driver may have done something truly unforgivable but they can still redeem themselves. Specifically they could stop drinking and do good deeds to atone for their sins. Even if they cant repay that debt they would be for trying their best. When anakin breaks free of the dark side its too late for his actions to be forgiven but its never too late for redemption. Nothing vader could do would forgive his sins but hed do anything to make them better and thats what made him a good person at the very end.'},\n",

In fact there is an entire industry homeowners liability insurance dedicated to mitigating this risk. So regardless of your opinion it is is your legal responsibility at least in the United States. You might be able to get out of it in court but youre much more likely to just end up settling with someone who sues your for it.'},\n",

       "  'arguments': 'Ive thought this for a long time and the recent surge in media awareness has brought this idea to the forefront of my mind. Resisting arrest is currently a felony offense in multiple states USA.. but anecdotally the charge is used to basically trump up the offenses committed by the perp. For those of you who are unaware it is still a felonyagainst the law to resist an unlawful arrest meaning that as a citizen obeying the law in a circumstance which gives the police officer no legal grounds to arrest you...they can still arrest you and you arent even allowed to flinch.I think this practice is toxic to our society. Psychologically and physiologically our first reaction to aggressive actions is defense so resisting arrest statutes are legally punishing citizens for their natural instincts. Now Im not saying civilians should be allowed to resist with deadly force or even excessive force but there needs to be some protection for civilians resisting in a reasonable fashion. That may not be the perfect wording or solution but its coming from a layman. so the problem is deeper than policy its the psychology involved with the entire arrest procedure. My mind is still set that USA arrests and policing are ripe with abuse but the root is not these laws its the people and traditions. Id still like to see more protection for civilians but allowing resisting arrest probably isnt the right avenue a new generation of judges may be more lenient towards it but thats a different story. I cant remember the policy on giving out deltas but youre points were very clear. Especially when you circled back to its a problem with individual officers not the system while I agree that the officer is obviously the main factor I think there is a systemically induced fear on both sides which is not addressed and maybe even escalated by allowing civilians to resist.',\n",

My entire analysis of evolution has been based on the idea that macroevolution is false. With this in mind after discussing Darwin and evolution at a high school level I formulated a view that I still hold to this day. Evolution occurs on small scales with species but these species do not hold a common ancestor. I cannot say for certain how many species of birds existed at the beginning but I certainly accept that there are more species now because species adapt and natural selection takes hold. I do not believe however that humans are direct descendents of any species and I do not believe that birds and dogs for example had any common ancestor. In forming this belief I have rejected certain levels of scientific consensus but I have never rejected any information that I felt refuted this. In any case what I am looking for are examples that prove that a dog may have had the same ancestor as a bird or something along those lines. I am not looking for the only facts that I have been offered that finches in the Galapagos developed different beaks.',\n",

Based on your starting argument It sounds as though you understand some of the basic principles of evolution and that you have an idea of how the scientific method works even if you arent yet willing to accept the conclusion that all species on Earth descended from a common ancestor. My assumption here and please correct me if Im wrong is that you are not yet willing to accept common ancestry because it directly conflicts with a core belief that you hold which is to say that you believe that all species on Earth came to exist exactly as they are through creation. In other words the two ideas are mutually exclusive they cannot both be true. You seem to be standing on the precipice of a difficult decision. It seems to me that you are ready to accept that certain truths can be revealed through the scientific method and that these truths can be more reliable than the things we learn through our cultural heritage but youre not ready to let go of the beliefs that were taught to you through your familys cultural heritage. The evidence for common ancestry and evolution by way of natural selection is staggering. I suspect youve been exposed to enough of it. I dont think that your problem is that you havent seen evidence for common ancestry I think that your problem is that you are unwilling to accept the possibility that your beliefs could be wrong. Until you are able to do so nothing we say will be able to change your view.There are many people that believe in god and accept evolution as fact. Theres nothing wrong with that. However one cannot accept that evolution is true while also holding the belief that life on earth has always existed in its current form. These ideas are at odds with each other. And as difficult as it may be to accept the evidence is overwhelmingly in favor of a . billion year old earth and creatures who evolved by way of natural selection.'},\n",

Unsurprisingly the thread has been inundated with comments from people most of them women telling her that she is being too hard on herself that she is gorgeous that she should appreciate youth and other platitudes. While I get that these people are coming from a good place I dont think its the right thing to do for the following reasons.Its ultimately very condescending. What the commenters are saying when they say Youre wrong youre beautiful!!!!! is that is in capable of objectively analyzing herself and that she has to defer to strangers for that information that she cant discern for herself. I think its very clear to her that she is not a runway model and that she is a little obese so trying to tell her that she cant see herself properly in the mirror comes off more as an insult or a youre just saying that to make me feel better moment.I also think that its a good thing when people can look at themselves in an objective way. Very few people face their own flaws and never do anything about them because they are fed this love yourself no matter what BS so they go on with a bad personality or a bad diet and never wonder what they are doing wrong but instead blame other people Or in this case the media for their problems. I can appreciate people who see the flaws in themselves because then they can take the next step and work to improve themselves. In terms of beauty I believe that most of it is controllable through dress hairstyle and most importantly maintaining health. They are all controllable things and we all have the power to take control of that. This is what I believe people should put more emphasis on if someone questions their appearance. Tell them that if they dont like how they look then they have the power to change it and that you believe that they can.',\n",
       "  'counters': 'Your reasoning is valid but I disagree with the response you choose. Lets talk about the Facebook link you showed. To be blunt the woman would not be considered physically beautiful out of context. If your point is that it is inaccurate to say she is objectively beautiful then youre correct. Try to consider however that the people commenting on her beauty may be doing so in an effort to be compassionate. Although the situation might seem simple theres actually quite a few factors involved that influence the response. First does she look arrogant or attention seeking? Shes not the one posting the image nor did she necessarily know how many people would see it. Shes showing a vulnerable moment and people empathize with her. Saying youre beautiful is another way of saying we care about you even if it doesnt literally translate to that in the English language. And before you begin preparing counterarguments yes there are certainly situations where telling a person theyre beautiful is more harmful than helpful. And yes a person might misinterpret peoples intentions. Communication isnt perfect but in this situation I think the comments were appropriate. Try to see peoples intentions and consider that in your viewpoint.You also mention how allowing people to see their own flaws allows them to improve themselves. I completely agree. But look back at the Facebook photo. The woman already has makeup and decent clothing. If she were wearing rags I guarantee the comments would be more critical. What people see in this picture is a woman who is dissatisfied with her image despite trying the best with what she has. Criticism wont get her much farther. Having positive feedback can make a tremendous difference in a persons day and thats what most of the comments are aiming for. Call it lying or dishonesty or false hope at the end of the day everyone benefits from a kind gesture. Although many people dont realize it the purpose of this subreddit is to change a persons view not necessarily reverse it. Like I said before I agree with your points on these kinds of comments having the potential to sound condescending or blind a person from their problems. Whats important is that you dont generalize this logic to every situation where a person shows their worries about being attractive. Your post makes it seem like nobody should EVER call an unattractive individual beautiful there are a range of appropriate and inappropriate situations.'},\n",

These threats have enabled mainstream media coverage to create a straw man of any opposition to them and has poisoned the well for anyone who finds their views problematic that wants to have a public dialogue about them.

Here is what I came up with.Anita SarkeesianZoe QuinnEvery article mentions the threats and only two provide anything close to objective coverage of the controversy. The narrative for almost all mainstream coverage of these women universally supports them and an inordinate portion of these articles focuses on harassment from a small group of psychopaths and trolls which usually includes quotes of some of the most tasteless comments for shock value. Because of this I believe that the threats and trolling these women have experienced has greatly helped their cause. People unfamiliar with the games industry who read these articles are led to believe that a large portion of those opposing these women are psychopath basement dwellers making rape threats. Because this narrative helps their movement so much I believe that feminists who support the actions of these women can definitely help their movement by creating many fake anonymous accounts and viciously threatening feminist public figures with them. Drawing from this while hardcore members of Gamergate have undoubtedly trolled and threatened these women I believe a decent portion of the vitriol against these women is posted by their supporters.',\n",

As for Whats in this drink? I imagine he just handed her a drink which she drank without actually knowing if it was vodka or a martini or whatever. When she drank it she realized it was stronger than she was expecting and asked Hey whats in this drink? So drink refers to the glass and liquid as one object not the liquid in the glass specifically.So dont worry Frank Loesser wasnt advocating rape when he wrote the song.

If it was a regular case it never would have gone to the grand jury. Looking at the evidence its quite clear there is no way he would have been convicted. The grand jury saved the state a lot of money by examining the evidence and throwing the case out.

This means that before charges are brought there is an on the record version of events that the defense can call back to and challenge if the cops try to change their stories later.. Grand juries often force prosecutors to present more evidence.

I dont think theres anything wrong with asexuality or bisexuality or any form of sexuality that doesnt hurt someone. I am biromantic and I can sort of understand being heteroromantic or homoromantic. But I have not heard a description of aromantic that does not make me feel like those people need help. From my perspective romantic attraction is just a natural extension of normal love like the love you have for your friends or family. To fall in love means to trust and care about someone else even more than you do about your friends enough to want to spend your life with them and dedicate a significant amount of your time and resources to their happiness and your mutual happiness. I think love is very important to being mentally and emotionally healthy. I dont think you can be emotionally healthy if you dont have any friends if you shun people and never express love. So when people say that they are physically incapable of loving and trusting someone enough to enter a romantic relationship I feel like something has to have gone wrong. Sexuality is one thing. Sexuality is about physical response and physical acts it is who turns you on and who you want to have sex with. Bodies are weird things physical reactions can range into bizarre in most situations I mean consider allergies and the actions people take are their own business again so long as nobodys getting hurt. But romantic feelings are based in emotion and thought and when something is very different with emotion and thought when you are lacking something that most people have that has to do with emotion and thought we call it a mental disorder. People who are lacking the ability to properly control their motivation and attention have ADHD. People who are lacking the ability to feel alright most of the time have Depression or Bipolar disorder. People who are lacking the ability to distinguish reality are schizophrenic or have delusions. So why are people who are lacking the ability to form romantic relationships...considered fine? Why is there a disconnect between the view of someone who cant make friends such as those with Schizoid Personality Disorder which we do consider problematic and people who can make friends but can never take it any further than that people with Aromanticism which we dont consider problematic?I guess the crux of my argument is that I believe there are different kinds of love of varying strengths. Love for your mom for your grandma for your aunt for your best friend for inanimate things. And I think romantic love is kind of the epitome of it something to strive for. Its one thing to not be in love or not be looking for love but to say youre actually just totally incapable of it? I call that mental illness.Change my view?',\n",

First and this is the part you identify that it must be inconsistent with developmentalsocial norms. But secondly and importantly it also has to genuinely cause suffering. If of the people in the world like blue and liked red you can argue that not liking blue fits the first criteria. But youd be pretty hardpressed to say that it fits the second as theres nothing intrinsic about liking red which causes harm of suffering. It would clearly be silly to classify liking red as a mental illness just because most people didnt.Now here you also argue that the inability to have romantic relationships constitutes harm. But aromantic people as far as I know dont go through life longing for a romantic relationship and suffer because they cant form one. If they did they wouldnt identify as aromantic. Instead what youre saying is that they cant enjoy a pleasure that you personally happen to enjoy. But I think this has about as much logic as saying that someone who cant enjoy video games for example is mentally damaged or someone who cant enjoy classical music has something wrong with them. Aromantic people presmuably just lack the little switch in their minds which drives most people to form romantic relationships as long as they dont suffer why should you say theres anything wrong with them?'},\n",

       "  'arguments': 'tldr or the way I shouldve phrased the thread initially Abortion is a form of selfdefense. Those who believe you have the right to use deadly force in selfdefense should also support abortion in at least some cases if not all. The main justification for being progun is that people need guns to defend themselves. Unique to arguing that people should carry guns as opposed to pepper spray or other selfdefense tools is that guns are used to kill not incapacitate. By being progun you are progiving people the right to choose to kill another person. A circumstance in which you would be allowed to do so under the castle doctrine stand your ground laws etc. would be that the other person is threatening your property or body. Progun activists cant really argue that you have to know your attacker intends to kill you as by the time you know they mean to kill you as opposed to rob you assault you etc. its likely too late for your gun to be effective. Ultimately the progun argument relies on one ordinary person being given the power to decide to end someone elses life without the need for lengthy deliberation that stateadministered capital punishment requires.Next the main justification for being prolife is that fetuses have personhood and deserve the same rights as people. If youre progun however youre arguing that someone has the right to kill another person if that person is intruding on their property or threatening their body. This definitively rules out cases where the mothers health is at risk and the mother would choose to preserve her own life first as in the infamous recent case of a woman dying in Ireland of medical complications after being denied an abortion. However it can be more broadly applied to other less critical abortions. For the same reason you would be justified in shooting to kill someone who is assaulting you or entering your home you should be justified in killing someone who is literally occupying your body for months. At the very least abortion must be legalized in cases of rape as you never consented to even the possibility of having a person invade your bodyproperty. This doesnt mean progun people are in any way obligated to personally prefer abortion for themselves just as they may not choose to shoot an intruder within their home but they should support legal abortion on the basis that others should be given that choice. A counterargument I can foresee is that to someone who is progun an attacker forfeits their right to life by being a criminal and fetuses are innocent. However this argument doesnt really fly. Firstly theres no way of knowing why an intruder has entered your home maybe they were forced to by someone else or coerced into it. Secondly even if a fetus has technically not consciously committed a crime it is still by its very existence invading another persons bodyproperty if that person did not consent to it being there. If you invite a personfetus into your homebody you dont have the right to kill them but in order to remain logically consistent you should be able to remove them with deadly force in both cases.Finally theres no corollary here because prochoice arguments dont rely on personhood theres no hypocrisy in being progun rights or progun control because its a completely separate issue.',\n",
       "  'counters': 'Im a gun control advocate but I dont think that the use of deadly force is explicitly a thing that gun owners are after. Its more that a gun is at least perceived as effective and that death is an unfortunate side effect. A homeowner or victim may not be able to afford or reliably wield a less lethal force. Guns are somewhat cheap and easy to use. Used effectively they carry little risk. I could ask for a less lethal method of protection but it would include either increased cost just to get someone to behave or increased risk your bat or whathaveyou might not do the trick and now you risk assault on your person. While the gun advocate may value life they see it as unfair that they should spend an inordinate amount of money or risk personal harm just to prevent something that should not be happening to them. It seems appropriate to offset the risk to the transgressor they already know that they shouldnt be doing what they are doing. They also know that they may meet someone whos unwilling to part with their property or accept assault. Its less that a gun owner takes the life of a transgressor and more that the transgressor risks his own life and loses it. Sure it might be convenient for the gun advocate not to defend his person or his property but that is merely what one attempting to harm or steal from the gun advocate hopes to be true.Removing a guest is fairly different from removing a fetus. Its reasonable to assume that a guest is physically capable of removing themselves from your property but not reasonable to assume that a fetus could remove itself from your body. One could make the argument that provided there was consent to the sexual encounter and that one consciously took the risk of pregnancy that someone carrying a fetus is obligated to carry it until such time as it could reasonably exist outside their body. Pregnancy lengths vary but are always of some length around months barring complications.Im a gun control advocate and prochoice but I dont see progun and prolife as in opposition. Very few people value life without any qualifiers. When people are prolife they are so because they believe that the child that will result from allowing a pregnancy to term is relatively innocent of any real crime.

We have to ask Would consent have to be given explicitly in this context? and the answer is yes engineering a situation where somebody could do anything to him without fear of reprisal in order to make a point is not equivalent to agreeing to have sex with anybody. The assumption that certain things might happen doesnt mean that he consented to those things. Itd be like walking into an enemy camp to kill a general you might assume that youd be killed if youre captured and yes youre putting yourself in a situation where you could be captured but that doesnt mean youre okay with being captured.The real point of contention is whether he consented to everything that would happen to him or if he simply allowed people to do whatever they wanted to him the language of another installation with similar if not the same rules says that Abramovi took a passive role not a willing one. It seems fair to say that Shia given his outrage also intended his role to be passive not willing and in sex both parties have to take a willing role or the sex is not consensual. The audience member was the one who made the choice to do what she did to him whereas he simply didnt resist. Im unclear on how or why you think having sex with that woman was his decision.There could conceivably be a context in which consent is explicitly given from the outset but in this morally dubious situation we cannot assume that consent was implied from what we know.I think its right to say that he was raped.

Hell I sometimes get it wrong when Im not paying enough attention especially when it gets back into less recent history English speakers know automatically that th century and th century refer to s and s but how many of us automatically make the shift when we hear th century?The only issue I can see is that when discussing Romanera history around the time BC AD it might make referring to the st Century AD a little more difficult.

My sister was speaking about leaving her money to her kids after her passing and I casually mentioned how I dont believe Id leave any.

Since my sister only seems to argue by using mindless platitudes she just kept saying you take care of your own over and over and my mother just kept telling me that is wrong without explaining why Id like to have a discussion on it here to see if I really am mislead in my views. Consider the following scenarioI have amassed a large fortune and have grown to be about . I had my kids in my s and so they are now in their s. My assumption would be that during the first or so years I have taken care of their educational costs provided for their basic needs and hopefully shown them the value of a dollar while still allowing them a life not bound by severe monetary constraints. After their s when they have begun providing for themselves I will be there as a backup should something truly catastrophic and unforeseen happen but they would be largely left to their own devices. After or so years of that when I die I would plan on leaving all my wealth to charities of my choice. I dont even think Id leave anything for the grandkids education as I believe that falls under the responsibility of the parents or even the children to properly finance and plan.The reasoningStatistics of the secondgeneration blow all the inheritance money during their lifetime. That statistic climbs to when you move into the thirdgeneration. To me this indicates that leaving a large inheritance to children who did not work for the money leads them to invest it poorly and blow it on frivolous spending Im not saying this happens in all cases as I know medical bills and a billion other situations could arise that would necessitate the costs but Im saying it is the most common reason.Ethics I dont believe that people should benefit simply by being born into a beneficial situation. Being born to wealthy parents shouldnt be like winning the lottery for your entire life. As I mentioned these kids would not feel the claws of poverty during their entire childhood why should they be guaranteed these lottery winnings well into adult life when they are supposed to be responsible for themselves? Moreover leaving this wealth to the children will actually negatively affect their lives as it will foster laziness and lack of ambition.

I know quite a few people that have one and have shot a few variants of them. Heres what I think of them personally.What I think of the AR is its a bunch of expensive accessories attached to a gun. The accessories go with a theme or purpose of what role the AR is suppose to fill. If I go to the range and show any interest in someones AR theyll ask me if I want to try it then point to all of the little assessors they bought for it.

I think those are better than an AR. gauge is so versatile you can buy the right ammo for the kind of place you live with more flexibility than what the . or xmm has. Where an AR will over penetrate and risk hitting neighbors in a firefight you can get the exact rounds you need to protect yourself be effective and not kill anyone through drywall with guage which you can easily find at in most stores that sell ammo. If you predict your firefight is only going to be defending your apartment from an intruder then gauge bird shot is the lethal choice against a human threat and considerate of your neighbors safety.

While you should always be aware what direction you are shooting the tumbling of a round will cause it to lose power quicker than a gauge slug or Buck.The AR is much softer recoiling than a shotgun and easier to control than a handgun. You can create an AR thats more compact and easier to use in a house buy buying a Short Barreled Rifle tax stamp from the ATF or buying an AR Pistol. As a recreational firearm it is fun to shoot the intermediate rifle cartridge its chambered in makes it great for gun. As a defensive weapon its accurate reliable and easy to shoot. When NRA supporters say that the bells and whistles that they stick on their big black gun are cosmetics I disagree. Some things are cosmetic. But most things foregrips magpuls optics ect are features that help your tool to what it does better. So in this I agree with you somewhat. In addition to accessories that may or may not make the firearm better the AR platform is extremely modular. The ability to change from a .. to . blackout to . Beowulf to cailbers Ive never heard of to meet the exact needs of anyone who needs a rifle makes this one platform good for anyone from farmers to competitive shooters to hardline survivalists. I agree that intermediate rifle calibers will not be the end all of armed revolution or repelling an invasion. The supposed enemy will have so much more hardware and firepower than any group of AR toting militiamen. However they would be the backbone of any urban assaultdefense supporting those who are waging the war of attrition with ambushes and sneaky underhanded tactics. I really think that the AR is a good rifle that meets the needs and wants of a large number of people. I believe that it is the everymans firearm and helps lessen the number of physical firearms that someone would need just by being modular. I think I skimmed the surface on why the AR has a purpose for a commoner. The topic of discussion shouldnt be this firearm. What people are afraid of is what this and any other intermediate rifle caliber rifle caliber and pistol caliber firearm can do to human life in a short time span in the wrong hands.'},\n",

They hid their brush strokes tried to create something close to a photograph. This is loosely called realism. Then a stylistic change happened. Painters started painting representations of objects. Maybe they were not super realistic maybe you could see the brush strokes. Maybe they were just painting the light that an object gave off. This was different than realism but they were still focused on painting things. This was called impressionism. Then the guy I linked came along and decided fuck painting things Im going to paint a painting. Just a painting. It doesnt have to represent or look like an object it can just be paint on canvas. This was considered radical and launched several other branches of art.It sounds silly now and if some dude came along painting black squares we wouldnt give two shits.

       "  'arguments': 'All drugs should be legal is a very popular view on reddit or at least its proponents are very vocal here. I dont believe this is possible without dire consequences that outweigh whatever benefits may exist. There have been quite a few s arguing AGAINST this particular view of mine including one that was mistitled to make it look like he agreed with me.To clarify Im not endorsing the status quo in terms of drug policy. I personally think the drugs that are illegal should be the worst in terms of dependence and bodily harm. For instance I personally dont use marijuana but I believe its ridiculous that cannabis use is illegal while alcohol and tobacco much more harmful and addictive drugs are legal. This applies to crack heroin powder cocaine crystal methamphetamine etc. Im opposed to the legalization of drugs that have much higher addiction potential and are much more bodily harmful than drugs that are currently legal. I also do think its a good idea to focus more state effort on addiction recovery.The main argument for the legalization of ALL substances is that it will allegedly curb the power of drug cartels that commit horrendous acts of violence all over the world. Ive heard a lot of vague arguments that we should tax and regulate these drugs in order to curb abuse while cutting cartel profits. These two goals are generally at odds with each other. Any effective method of undercutting cartels will make hard drugs more available to everyone. You can regulate them all you want but youll only accomplish the intended purpose of cutting profits to drug cartels if you make cocaine and heroin easier to get elsewhere. I believe that there will be more addicts and heavy drug users if this is the case.Currently there are more tobacco and alcohol users in the US than marijuana users and I credit that to the fact that marijuana is illegal and harder to get. This is DESPITE the fact that alcohol and tobacco are more harmful and addictive than marijuana. Sure youll be able to get your hands on it if you really want to but the law does deter millions. Imagine if cocaine and heroin were sold in stores like tobacco is now. Would you feel safe going to the store knowing that an addict might be holding it up for his fix? Would you feel safe letting your kids go to college knowing that a senior could purchase them a lifelong addiction and possible early death at the ?I understand that many children already live in an environment where drugs are readily available but millions of others are stopped from using hard drugs by the presence of the law and we need to stop and think whether we want to give that away over libertarian principles or possible mitigation of street violence. As for the libertarian argument that its a state infringement upon rights I personally find rights to be a bit more nuanced than that and the most simplyworded right isnt always the one that should prevail in a given situation. In this case I consider my right to protection from addicts and addictive substances more important than others rights to use those substances. There are horrible costs to the War on Drugs but I dont see any feasible alternative in the realm of legalizing all addictive substances.',\n",
       "  'counters': 'I think you need to break down the problem into two categories in which one I agree with you the other I disagree. Dealing drugs which have been made illegal should be illegal. The production transport distribution and sale of illicit drugs should be a crime. The use of drugs which are illegal should not be a crime. Portugal made all drug use legal but drug sales illegal and it has worked well for them. This changes the power balance between the user and the dealer meaning that an unsatisfied user can report the dealer but never feels animosity to the police officers who may help them in taking down a dodgy dealer. This would mean that drugs would become a valid market allowing normal market forces to change the makeup of the market from people who splice bug spray into weed to make it seem more potent to those who produce good quality safe produce. I also think that some drugs should remain illegal like ice crack heroin etc for the near future. I think legalising the less addictive drugs regulating their production and taxing their sale would reduce the number of users in total. This would allow the market to prepare for harder things by reducing the relation to crime. Maybe in ten or fifteen years the market would be ready to handle the sale or more potent and addictive drugs but for now it would cause too much collateral damage in the form of people seeking more money to pump into the addiction and turning to illegal means to get it.'},\n",

       "  'counters': 'OK I guess Im going to write this one long diatribe and save it rather than just rewriting it every weeks and putting it into yet another body camera thread.Potential issues with body cameras First we need to address the fact that as of today there isnt a perfect body camera on the market. For a system to record an entire shift it will have to meet the following standardsa. Armored like a truck. Seriously. Body cameras will take just as much abuse as everything else an officer carries and they have to be reliable.b. Lightweight. Officers today already carry lbs of gear. Any significant addition of weight runs the risk of elimination via OSHA lawsuit.c. Dependable. This goes along with armored but more to the electronics side. They cant fail. And if you think that this is an easy task you need to think about the situations that officers encounter. They will have to work in snowstorms at below in sandstorms at in driving rain etc.d. Battery life. Some departments work s some work s and some work s. And all of them have overtime at the end of a shift. So to be safe youve got to have hours of battery life minimum.e. Storage space. Youre going to have to have at least as much storage space as you have battery life. So if youve got hours of battery life that means assuming recording at SD x fps you need MBs or . GBhr or . GB worth of space. To account for other things that have to live on that drive call it GB. And thats for standard definition. Now lets talk about cost. This is a complex discussion because we have to address the initial startup costs as well as the ongoing maintenance costs. For the purposes of this discussion lets use the standard police department for a mediumsized city K citizens. This means youve got about officers that work patrol with on duty at any given time. Weve already established that the product thats necessary doesnt exist on the market today but lets pretend it does. The going rate at the moment for the product that matches the ideal product is about assuming youre buying in bulk. To equip this department with sufficient cameras youre going to have to buy at least . Gotta have spares. So thats K. Now you have to buy all the other stuff that goes along with the cameras. Batteries replacement storage mounts hardware etc. Call that another K. Now you have to get the service contracts on the cameras so that when they break someone will fix them and get them back to you. Theyre more than the cost of the cameras but well pretend theyre the same cost so thats another K.So weve bought a bunch of cameras and the stuff we need to make them work and spent K. What else? Now we need to talk about software. Specifically evidence management software. And hardware because we have to store all that video somewhere right? So lets size some hardware. Assuming that you have officers work per day at GBofficerday youre amassing video at a rate of TB per day or TB per month. Depending on the departments policies and the courts requirements this evidence has to be stored for a defined amount of time. The shortest policy Ive ever seen is months and industry standard seems to be about years. Some departments store for .So going with the industry standard of years youve got . PB of data to store. Now I dont work in IT but my brother does so I called him. Admittedly hes an exec but he farmed out this question for me. He came back with U servers TBserver RAID with an acquisition cost of .MM. For just the hardware. Not to mention the costs of racks power etc. Or service.So taking those things into account youre now spending MM on your storage array. But it has to be redundant so you have a tape system offsite that will run you another K to back it all up. So youre at .MM for the hardware and software for your hardware. Now we have to add the costs of the evidence management system. Thats going to run you K or so a year. So were at .MM for your hardware and software solution.This ignores all the other infrastructure to make this system work networking wiring docking cradles access systems etc. Call that another K.So now weve got stuff we have to add people to run it all. Figure an addition . FTE to run the arrays and FTE for the EMS storing archiving recalling FOIA prepping evidence going to court etc at K a year youve got an ongoing cost of K. So you have to figure that in to your startup costs. So .MM plus the cost for the cameras so youre looking at .MM for first year costs. Ongoing costs are going to be in the MM per year range.So lets compare that against our average departments budget. This theoretical department is looking at a budget around MM per year so your first years costs are of the budget with ongoing costs around . Given that of a departments budget goes to personnel costs this means that theres literally no way to fund this program without additional taxes. So weve got cameras and money. Lets talk policies. There seems to be a belief that because officers carry guns they are somehow exempt of the protections that are afforded to every other citizen in the United States. I dont know how to dispel this notion but lets just leave alone for the moment that any proposal that requires officers to be videotaped in the bathroom on the phone at lunch etc will be dead on arrival. Theres no way any union would agree to it and even if it were forced through by fiat itd be overturned by the courts.Moving beyond that absurdity we now need to address all the things that officers see and do that would be recorded. They go into peoples homes cars businesses hospital rooms etc. They interview juveniles rape victims assault victims bystanders and people not associated with crimes. They see people at their very worst and everything that they record will have to be available unless FOIA laws are changed to the public. This is as true for Joe Citizen as it is for any highprofile citizen or celebrity. Do we as a society want to make this available to anyone with an FOIA request? To youtube? To liveleak? I personally dont but thats my opinion.Moreover this gets us into a discussion of the level of surveillance unlike anything weve ever seen. I guarantee that these databases will have facial recognition run on them which creates a record of every person an officer sees related to an encounter or not. The FBI has an active system that is in its infancy that will allow this to happen on a countrywide scale. Apparently Im the only person that finds this a little too far. Even the ACLU has issues with this kind of database. All in all I am a touch tired of hearing from people about how easy a solution this is. You need to look up the term panacea. Memorize the definition. Body cameras are a panacea.'},\n",

Being from the south all of my old friends are posting articles from conservative weekly about how the verdict was right.

I feel as if he could have been found guilty of manslaughter. shots? YES. That is excessive. Four were to the handsarm and two to the head. That along with the witness testimonies for the most part saying he had surrendered and still was shot constitutes man slaughter. Due to the conflicting testimonies though he couldnt be charged with murder. Not to mention this all started with Brown robbing a store. The video of Brown stealing the cigarillos shows him aggressively shoving the convenience store clerk as he attempted to confront him. This doesnt seem like the temperament of a guy who would just surrender when confronted by a police officer not to imply that he didnt. Now to the point! I have no idea what happened on that day and how it all unfolded. I have no idea what the motivations of the police officer were. I have no idea if Brown actually grabbed at the gun of the officer. No one does. But all I am hearing about is how certain everyone is that is was somehow racially motivated. I understand it is totally possible that it was racially motivated or influenced in some way. But it is also equally possible that it was simply a matter of circumstance in which someone who had just robbed a store got too aggressive with a police officer and hasty decisions had to be made. I just feel that it is way too easy to mark up such a complex confrontation to a racially motivated slaughtering as a lot of people are acting like especially when nothing would have likely happened had Brown not initiated confrontation with police by robbing a store. I think it is much more likely that the officer simply had to make a hasty decision and went a bit over the top. Maybe I have misunderstandings about the facts and if that is the case PLEASE let me know.

The prosecutor himself admitted during the case that a lot of witnesses changed their stories multiple times usually after being contacted by the media.

They insinuated long before it was even possible to have all of the facts that it was nothing more than police brutality and racial profiling. I dont know if it was or wasnt and I am not here to argue that. But because the media insisted that it was before they could confirm that with facts citizens across the country especially in Ferguson believed it. That helped spark the protests which in turn opened the door to looters taking advantage of the situation and destroying peoples lives in the process. I think that if the media were allowed to only present facts that had been verified and not make any unsubstantiated claims from those it would go a long way towards making sure this doesnt happen in the future.

I bring it up because I recently changed where I live and I miss having a real true best friend. I met a girl who has a boyfriend long distance and they seem serious and I dont think Im in the mood for a relationship right now anyway but I really enjoy hanging out with her it feels like hanging out with my old best friend and at least on my side so far it doesnt feel romantic.But I cant imagine if it ever escalates into true best friend mode that it will stay like that. I also wonder if I can really be best buds with her in general we have things in common but arent the perspectives of girls and guys in this world a bit too different to relate completely.

I noticed that for the majority of words that have alternate pronunciations I mostly tended toward the British way i.e I pronounce the letter Z by itself as ZedI find however that whenever I use these words most people go out of their way to correct me. I usually try without too much insistence to explain that there are different pronunciations for the same word and I say it differently due to my heritage. If they push the issue Im happy to concede and change my pronunciation during the rest of the conversation but I still find their insistence mildly offensive. Im aware Im in a particular country that speaks English a certain way but to completely discount alternate and in many cases the original pronunciation as wrong seems nationalistic at best and conceited at worst. Everyone should be mindful of the culture they are in and I can see how I might come across as aloof but I dont do this to be different I do this because I am different just as anyone from any other nationality is different. Its not an attempt to subvert American pronunciation as wrong because it is just as right as any other nations pronunciation. If I could just chalk this up to nationalism I would accept it and move on as just a facet of American culture. However it feels like its just aimed at me. If a Canadian was to pronounce about as aboot the worst that will happen is a few jokes. That is ok but my situation is apparently not ok. Please change my view.Because so many people have asked here is more information that I should have included in my original post Yes I have an accent. However I have found that it is a strange mix of Australian and American pronunciation most Americans say I sound either British or Australian and if they think I sound American I sound like Im from the northeast where Ive never lived . Because of this I always explain my accent in the context of where I grew up Missouri and my mother teaching me to speak I grew up using Australian slang though I often did not learn it was Australian only until much later in life. I have since for the most part stopped using the slang because it requires explaining whole new words. My pronunciation on the other hand is inherently a part of my accent and because I have to explain that just about every time I meet someone in my mind justifies my pronunciation. I do not think that the British pronunciation is any more right than the American it was a mistake in my part to say it was original. I did not intend sound uninformed or conceited My peers often go out of their way to correct me in a very specific and individual way. They say that because Im American and was raised in America I should sound American. However I find they are ignoring not only my obvious accent but also the profound effect my mother has has on not only my speech patterns but also the words I use. I often try to identify as both Australian and American because to me that is what I am. When my pronunciation gets confusing I will happily switch for the conversation. However when others cannot seem to understand why I sound like that and instead attribute it to me attempting to sound different is when I take offense. In a formal environment I will adhere to the standard which is usually American in nature because that has a very precise meaning of correct',\n",

In fact that is nationalistic and conceited the idea that modern British pronunciations are somehow older or more legitimate than American ones.Much like humans didnt come from modern apes but are merely another branch sharing a common ancestor so too with languages. American and British English have both been evolving in parallel from the same origin. Neither is older neither is more legitimate. Furthermore this is a simplification there are many commingled offshoots making up each of those dialects.Most people are quite ignorant about language and believe the follies of prescriptivism. They believe there is a right better or more legitimate version of a wordas you yourself impliedand will correct apparent transgressions. This is a normal function of sociolinguistics which on a local scale ensures intelligibility and on a larger scale creates divisions.Itd be nice perhaps if everyone accepted every deviation.

       "  'arguments': 'To my understanding Libertarians advocate a society where all interactions take place based on voluntary mutual agreements.I am not going to argue the merit of that ideology itself in fact I think it is fine. Instead I want to argue that the free markets advocated by most libertarians and most notably libertarian CEOs would create a situation that they themselves would think of as unfair.Heres the main argument against free markets while companies are no longer constrained by often inefficient government rules it allows for socalled slave wages and private corporate tyranny meaning that CEOs will have their employees working for the bare absolute minimum.Nonsense most Libertarians will say. A voluntary agreement cant be slavery. People have the choice to deny the job we offer.Which is correct. But also a bit naive. People are prepared to work very hard for very little. Corporations know this and it would be very difficult indeed to find a job anywhere where the employer would be kind enough to provide more than the bare minimum. Yes it will be voluntary. But will that make it any less cruel?But thats not my problem with libertarianism. seeing as you can argue that the benefits will outway the costs people will somehow unanimously refuse the lowest wages etc. My main point is that Libertarianism is contradictory. And heres why the government is fundamentally no different from a corporation providing services. Only here the services are police forces roads health care and all in all society itself. There is only one real difference and that is that in a democratic government citizens can elect their CEOsIf you as a CEO dont like the rules and taxes the government asks in return for allowing you to use its services you should just move your corporation to a different country. Or start your own. But of course you wont do that because you lack the resources or because you need the benefits of your country for keeping your corporation alive. Why its not a choice at all! Well welcome to the situation of a labourer faced with a free market. You have a choice. Kind of. Only its not a choice at all. If you truly consider this sort of voluntary interaction fair then you must also accept that you have no right to complain about the current status quo. And if you think it is unfair then you necessarily also deem the basics of a free market itself unfair. Therein I think lies the contradiction of Libertarianism. .',\n",
       "  'counters': 'The libertarian argument with regards to this is that government allows for corporations to have lower wages and hurt the working class through crony capitalism. Government agencies that impose regulations of various businesses more often than not have quite a few superfluous regulations that were lobbied for by corporations. Meeting these regulatory requirements makes it more difficult for people to start up a business which decreases competition. If these regulations were removed then more businesses could arise and would compete to have the best labour force which means they would have to offer slightly higher wages. I know what will come up is the proposal that these regulations keep us safe and some of them do. But its bad business to market an unsafe product. Because were in the st century and information can be spread quickly if a corporation is doing something unsafe for the public people will find out and there will be outcry which will hurt the company so its bast to make sure that the product is safe. As for your final paragraph I dont consider the current situation fair because of crony capitalism. But if you sign a contract voluntarily then it is a fair process. I dont see how this belief would make it so I cant complain about the status quo when the status quo is not a free market. As for how government is no different than a corporation with a corporation you sign a mutual agreement for work. You never sign an agreement with a government. The government has all sorts of power over you that a corporation does not. It can throw you in prison for what you do in your private life or not obeying a set of rules it outlined. Also government doesnt provide those services that you listed. It uses your money to hire private companies to provide those services. Now cutting out the middleman is where some libertarians disagree. Im a minarchist rather than an anarchist and ave no problem with that level of government. However roads for instance would still exist without government. They could be toll roads. Or if the roads lead to and near businesses the businesses could pay to have the roads made and periodically fixed through an annual budget which would be in a voluntary agreement between to two private enterprises. This is even done with some roads in america but is very uncommon because government usually acts as the middleman. While I dont agree that it would be better its also possible for a private police force to exist. People would buy insurance that would cover problems that normally the public police force deals with. When it becomes necessary the insurance company would work with the private police force to help you with the legal problem you face. Private investigators do exist.'},\n",

This means I can be in loving committed romantic relationships with multiple people at a time and my lovers can too. So Im going to come at it from that perspective.I remember a long time ago thinking as you do. A girl once asked me to be in an open relationship and I said Id rather not as Id just be looking for a replacement for her the whole time. It didnt seem stable really.Then due to a strange set of circumstances I found myself dating two women at once both knew about each other of course. I was stunned by how natural this felt. I didnt love either one less nor was I feeling a desire to chose between them. It was as natural as having two parents or two close friends or two children. You dont love one less in fact you sort of love each one more. Theres less expectation on each... I dont have to sit there thinking okay I like her but does she fulfill absolutely every desire in a relationship that Ill ever have until the end of time? Instead its just do I like being with this person do I care about her and does she feel the same about me?Pretty soon you start to realize that sex and romance arent off in some special categories unlike all other interpersonal relationships such that they and they alone must be unique in your life while all others can be shared. Theres no point to it. Im not looking for someone better to come long... rather Im looking to add more people to my close family as it were. Loves not a race to be won wherein you try to get the best trophy and put it in your closet for all time. Loves about building trust and love with people. Theres no reason to do this only with one person.And Im not at all afraid of commitment. I have no problem sitting down discussing retirement plans together. Nor am I thinking about replacing any of them with a better model as though women were all on some scale and Im looking for the one with the highest number of girlfriend points. I just enjoy being with them and hope to be with them for a very long time.So right now I have three girlfriends. Each is lovely in her own way. Some are more serious than others but each relationship can develop as it will. One of my girlfriends is with another man whos married to yet another woman and while Im sure that sounds strange as hell to most I found I dont worry about that at all. He seems pretty cool actually. I dont think of metamors thats a lover of your lover btw as competition or threats or people who might replace me... rather as coconspirators that can help me plan really awesome surprise birthday parties for my lovers.Nobody really replaces anybody for me. Heartbreak at losing a lover still hurts just as badly even when another lover is right there to comfort me. Getting a new lover doesnt replace the old at all its just another person just as getting a new friend doesnt replace a lost best friend. But now that Ive been doing this a while Ive found I dont lose lovers nearly so badly anymore. I was just last night hanging out with my ex of years. I still love her. And thats okay. And yes my girlfriends know that and thats fine with them too. I dont have to pretend to be over her either. Theyre not competing with her after all. Loves not a competition its a family.So thats one type of open relationship to consider. Yes I can technically sleep with whoever I want. No I dont actively seek new partners for the most part. They just sort of happen. Its nice. But theres no phobia of commitment here. I like the idea of settling down with someone for the long haul... and maybe also someone else. Im moving in with my girlfriend of a year and a half soon. Also the threesomes rock so theres that.'},\n",

Before I encountered polyamory I had a lot of relationships end in resentment because I fell in love with someone else while in a serious relationship. Mind you I felt no less love for the person I was in a committed relationship with and I never would have acted upon those feelings. It was painful for me but Im not one of those people that gets off on illicit romance and cheating.When I learned about open relationships I was single at the time I realized that it was the only relationship style that really resonated with me. Today I have a very committed partner and weve been happily together for about seven years now. We live together share a bank account and hes on my insurance. I genuinely believe that we will be together for years more maybe even for life. I have also had longterm romantic relationships outside of this one. My last partner lasted three years ended amicably and is someone that I consider one of the closest and best friends I have ever had. I have recently started dating another person and I could definitely see it becoming longterm. Its been a little over three months since we began seeing each other and we havent yet had sex so the sexytimes on the side thing is pretty much ruled out.

As for his existing relationships he has a wife and child and they live with his wifes committed partner. They are very much a family and I feel completely welcomed and cared about in their home. The point is I guess that this has in no way changed my relationship with my livein partner I refer to him as my anchoring partner. We still have sex the same amount cuddle and watch movies do chores together and even bicker about the little things just as much.

If the weight a society places on reason and verifiable fact is a measure of civilization then ours is in decline and has been since the Romantic Era which followed the Enlightenment. .I should note that a big exception to this argument is the institution of slavery which many Enlightenment thinkers appear to have put up with as a necessary evil or even to have endorsed.',\n",

The emergence of the narratives of importance that emphasize some figures over others only occurs over huge timescales and it may not be easy to identify who is important now and why they are because a. they arent yet universally recognized as correct or important and b. if they really are at the cutting edge of human thought then you and all of us are most likely poorly equipped to evaluate their positions on their merits.. Youre describing the beginning of Modern philosophy. Philosophically were pretty deep into the postmodern era now its easy to see the big dramatic things that the modernists got right because thats what modernity was all about big simple clean truths. Its harder to see the important things in postmodernism because theyre messy convoluted and not necessarily based on any easy fundamental premises. But thats also why theyre an improvement on modernism which in its cleanness and simplicity turned out to be massively flawed and dangerous.Among the major philosophies of our time or times just before ours Im not sure how old you are but Im and dont feel comfortable claiming stuff from the ss as mine are Feminism which is an inherently postmodern field of critical theory Subatomic physics which is arguably an example of science moving beyond strict empiricism and into new epistemological territory I say arguable because I wouldnt agree with it but the fact that the argument even makes sense to have is relevant and important Democratic socialism which is an area of political thought that meaningfully approaches the criticisms of strict capitalism that Marx raised without falling into the serious shortcomings that come with a modernist interpretation of socialismFurthermore achievements like the internet or to get more specific Wikipedia represent accomplishments in the human organization of knowledge that were literally unthinkable during the enlightenment. And in fact were pretty much unthinkable right up until a while after Wikipedia was already working.This is a drastically incomplete description of the important things going on in the intellectual world today but even that speaks to my point we have achieved heights of intellectual complexity that defy summary.As far as the weight of verifiable fact say what you like about the way we teach it but evolution wasnt proposed as a theory until the s. Einstein was alive just last century. The Higgs Boson was found this decade. Every example you can raise about intellectual failures in America today are example of people having arguments that is theres a side in favor not just about whether these things that didnt exist as ideas in the enlightenment are true but about whether to teach those true things to literal gradeschoolers.I call bullshit on you comparing that to a period in history when more than half of citizens in the leading intellectual nations died not knowing how to read.'},\n",

The answer is definitely not Always no matter what.To expand on point OP you are not entitled to information about anyone elses internal life. By definition triggers are an emotionally difficult thing to talk about. In practice many people wont be able to explain whether or why theyre choosing not to dismantle their triggers at the moment or ever. They dont owe you that explanation and trying to give it is an inherently painful experience.By not just believing what you believe but openly stating that belief in response to other peoples triggers as it seems like youve described yourself doing you are putting people who want to engage with you on an emotional level in the position of inflicting pain upon themselves in order to attempt to express the deep complicated and often subconscious or intuitive reasons that a. they are not prepared for the difficult project of dismantling this trigger and b. they may not be done needing the larger constellation of emotional and psychological defenses that manifest in part as the trigger youre addressing.In short not only are you wrong that people should always try to dismantle their triggers but youre actively causing harm by encouraging people to take that view.'},\n",

You go to buy a given good and find two choices one of which is slightly more expensive than the other but promises that it was produced using Sustainable forestry or the like. Now there are several problems with this. First of all given that the Green option is more expensive at no actual added utility to the enduser such consumerism is limited more to higherincome people who often buy not just for utility but for cosmetic luxury and an appearance of being environmentallyfriendly. In practice this means that ethical consumerism is at best a mostlyirrelevant niche market a lonely island in a sea of unethical behavior.Secondly it puts the impetus on the consumer not on the corporation to determine the responsible use of resources. A common argument used by libertarians is that issues like climate change and the globalized exploitation of sweatshop labor are selflimiting problems as people will generally prefer the more humanitarian purchase. In practice ethical consumerism is used as an excuse to abolish democraticallyimplemented regulations leaving huge questions the environment workers rights and the like to the will of a system that inherently values profit over superficial ethics.

       "  'arguments': 'NOTE those is not the stereotypical whiny Im a nice guy why dont girls like me post. I used to be one of those guys but I am not anymore. But I WANT to be that nice guy.I m was raised thinking that I would find a nice girl who I could spend the rest of my life with. Someone who I could just love for who they are as a person and vice versa and that no matter what happened we would always stick together. However recently Ive given up on this. My entire life I was the stereotypical nice guy who always cared about the feelings of others so much so that I would invite kids sitting alone at lunch to my table I would hang out with my friends if they seemed like they needed someone to talk to etc. My mom instilled in me from a very young age that above all I should respect women and that was the way to find love. Hold the door open for her be polite and courteousbuy her flowers etc. Anyways last year I met what seemed like the perfect girl. Beautiful funny ditzy intelligent basically everything I could ever want in a girl. Back then I believed there was a distinction between party rats and nice girls and she seemed to embody essentially everything about the nice girl. Well we made plans to hang out one night and she flaked on me. Then I found out the reason that she flaked to fuck the football teams th string running back who was known around campus as a player and had fucked like girls already first months of college. I stopped talking to her after that. As soon as she found a better option she just left me in the dust and never showed any regret for ditching me.The point Im trying to make is this most girls I have met in college have behaved this way. Even the ones I would never expect it from and the ones who said they werent that girl and wanted a nice guy. I used to laugh at nice guys on the internet but now I really feel for them. Im not ugly by any means and Ive had a little success but it was only when I pretended to be someone who Im not and basically acted like the girl didnt exist until the night we hooked up. I HATE acting like this but based on my experiences it seems like the only way. Do women really hope to find a nice guy? Because Im calling bullshit. Change my view.',\n",

And would you want to keep up that alpha behavior yourself to keep that type of woman? Because it sounds like you do still want to find someone who likes you as a person and youre not actually getting much enjoyment even when changing your behavior pays off in hookups.The problem is finding someone who can really connect with you and love you for who you are is a hard thing to do for everybody. You are by no means guaranteed for this to ever happen to you. But whatever slim odds you have they are only going to go down if you force yourself to act like someone else that you dont like. Or if you build up a relationship on mind games and theatrics just for the sake of getting the hookup to happen without regard for what comes afterwards.Another point people in college still have maturing to do. The women you met in college arent perfect any more than you are. And they were at a stage of life where its considered the best time to get out and have fun and experiment and not get tied down so youll have higher odds of running into flakes who dont really care about ditching you for whatever better comes along. These demographics may change as you get older.I cant speak for all women but when I was still single what frightened me was not feeling like I could trust men. Feeling like even someone who seems nice could just be doing anything to get some sex and that once that happened they wouldnt care anymore and if it never happened cause I was onto that bullshit theyd be all offended because oh you dont like nice guys after all then?! So what I wanted wasnt a matter of surface behavior that seemed nice guy vs. alpha it was a matter of finding someone I could trust. Someone who felt genuine someone that I not only wanted to be with but I could trust that they actually had just as much interest in me.If someone sleeps with you only because you act cold and she wants the attention and validation she has problems. Find yourself someone with less problems if you still want that to chase that loves you as a person ideal. And in the meantime if you just want some sex own up to that and learn how to be more honest about your intentions. Reading the Savage Love advice column is a great place to start.'},\n",

       "  'arguments': 'I do not think there is an inherent purpose to life. I believe that life is in fact an accident and that our existence is coincidental. Being so I also dont believe in eternal truths mainly in the notion that there is an inherent good that people should be trying to attain. If any purpose exists it is constructed within the person for otherwise why would people exist? It is not to serve nature surely for humans ultimately oppose nature especially in modern society. In the case that there was a God I suppose one could argue that we exists for the Gods sake but why? For entertainment? I am really not clear how purpose can be inherent and not constructed. The same goes for the greater good. There does not seem to be a good that exists from with out the person or societies. If there were a greater objective good why then with the exception of murder and incest are very few things seen as universally bad among all societys? And why are few things seen as universally good? For example in America it is seen as wrong to arrange a marriage especially among children under . But in many countries that is the standard. If a universal good exists how come there is so much variance as to what is right and wrong?However I believe this to be a good thing. As opposed to more traditional nihilism which equates meaningless to life being futile I believe that the lack of a notion of a greater good or purpose is a freeing thing. With no greater purpose or greater good one can construct it for oneself. The most important thing becomes ones personal experience in the world and maximizing that to its full potential. There is no worry of not meeting a cosmic standard the standards are within yourself. And so a person does not have to be limited from most any experience unless they so desire it.As such I would categorize myself as an ethical hedonist without any inherent purpose experience is the most important thing and pleasurable experience being the greatest kind of experience one should strive for that for themselves. However because all people are on this journey one persons search for pleasure cannot infringe on another. I fully believe if everyone felt this way society would be more functional as everyone would be operating on the basis of mutual respect. So Reddit Change My View about any and all of these things. Life having a purpose. The existence of an inherent good. The absence of these being freeing. The idea that if ethical hedonism were the standard society would be more functional.

Personally I consider myself a psychological egoist I believe that people do strive for pleasure above and perhaps to the exclusion of all other sources of motivation but to suggest that we have any obligation to do so doesnt make much sense to me. The drive toward pleasurable experience takes the form of an explanation of why we do what we do but not an ethical justification or motivation for doing so. You claim that society would function better if everyone lived by this principle. For the sake of argument I will assume that this idea is true. However if we acknowledge that everyone is purely selfmotivated I do not believe that I am or should be responsible for the functioning of society. If it so happens that my motivation and associated actions work in the favor of everyone else as well as myself of course it is nothing more than a happy coincidence.'},\n",

A simplified version of this theory because of the last item is conservatives are motivated by disgust reactions.My point is the problem is that Haidts methodology is flawed because he assumed the same things will effect a disgust reaction in liberals and conservatives. It is not true. His questions are too much conservative focused e.g. desecrating a flag. Liberals are simply disgusted by different things for example desecreating knowledge burning books or libraries.I think liberals feel more disgust over violence and blood for example. It is not simply a careharm thing I think perfectly voluntary violence like an MMA match with some blood will disgust liberals more than conservatives.Similarly ask them about how they feel about shooting a dog who is in incurable pain and debilitating disability and therefore it is a caring not harmful act liberals will feel more disgusted by it.So if you balance your questions properly you take into account different kinds of disgust you dont find liberals are less motivated by disgust than conservatives.Similarly it is not that liberals are less likely to respect authority but more like they respect different authorities the police less and scientists more.In loyalty Haidt focuses too much on loyalty to your nation or family and not your political movement or social class.

However other medical illnesses arent treated this way if you go to the doctor for a routine checkup and your cholesterol is high the doctor will attempt to intervene and the patient is expected to take the doctors advice.

A doctor will suggest having it checked and you can accept or decline. Cholesterol screening is a simple blood diagnostic. Its taken with other information such as age health status and symptoms to decide if the patient should try to lower cholesterol to lower their risk of cardiovascular problems. Diagnosing depression isnt a diagnosis not a test. Depression isnt a fixed mental state. Symptoms may come and go with stress or change in situation. To make an accurate assessment the patient needs to be seen by a mental health provider not the family doctor and a complete history needs to be taken.Usually when they talk about screening it means the patient fills out a short or question survey points are added up for each answer and a score suggests if the patient might need further follow up. It relies on the patient giving honest answers and being self aware of their feelings. But as you know people who are seriously mentally ill may not be the best judge of themselves.The thing is that the patient STILL must see a mental health professional to get a proper diagnosis. If theyre not ready to accept the possibility theyre not going to do. I dont believe the family doctor should try to play psychiatrist and try assorted psych meds he doesnt have the training and the patient isnt getting therapist support.A better solution is to teach people the value of mental health services. Get then them to trust mental health providers. Make mental health care more accessible and more affordable. Teach teens and young adults what is or isnt healthy behaviorthought and how to get help.

We built one of our systems inhouse yet when we put out to tender for developers one firm claimed to have experts in that very system that they had never seen. We now have the same Indian company doing both our development and testing and guess what? The number of defects in the code has plummeted. At least it has right up until the point we bring it all back inhouse for final user testing when its found to be total crap. We are now utterly shafted by this situation.

Its like something out of Kafka the code that my company owns we cant see because we have outsourced its ownership to a company so opaque and incompetent that it cant even find someone who can find the relevant lines of code to show me. We have no future pipeline in IT any more since all the entrylevel jobs now sit with another company in India. All the Analysts Architects Project Managers Senior IT Leaders etc who used to emerge from the development teams now dont come from anywhere meaning we have an ageing population in most of our remaining inhouse IT department. In all we have priorised quantity at the expense of quality and are now barely functioning as an IT department any more and it breaks my heart to see my company spending millions building systems that are so badly written that I know theyll end up spending an impossible fortune trying to maintain them and build on them in future. So is it morally wrong to outsource jobs overseas? No. Its just daft that companies think that handing over the crown jewels of their IT department is a good thing and believe me if youre not in control of your own code then you dont have a functioning IT department or that a company would hand over the job of talking to their own customers to another company. The old mantra remains true you gets what you pays for.'},\n",

I completely get that they can be extremely frustrating the quality can be less than theyre worth and when all is said and done may not actually save a business as much as they think. However I just started a job at an anesthesiologist billing office that uses a company in India to do their data entry a LOT of anesthesiologists use our service so theres a lot of data entry and it got me thinking that theres nothing actually wrong with outsourcing aside from just the potential poor quality but my work really benefits from it and they do a good job. The call centers I used to deal with at the airline would often try to hide the fact that they were outsourced. I dont think there should be a stigma. They provide a service at a lower cost. Why do I deserve a job more than Rahul Priya or Mahesh? If a company benefits from it why not? But is there something Im not seeing? ! Im totally up for a change lets do it! companies have been known to fire employees in order to outsource their jobs. conditions of the outsourcing company can be very poor and unpredictable. outsourcing takes away many entry level jobs that would help an employee get their foot in the door. companies have been know to use unskilled workers to do skilled work in the name of saving money instead of actually talented skilled people. In other words theyre potentially slowing down technological advances so they can pay less for codes and systems that are bugged and written by people that dont know what theyre doing and now they dont work properly. Again its not that I find these reasons necessarily wrong from a business standpoint. More from the perspective that I personally either find them shitty or distasteful therefore I can no longer say that I dont think there should be a stigma.',\n",

       "  'arguments': 'First of all I want to say that there is room in this discussion for personal preference. Obviously music enjoyment is not some scientific enterprise. There is music that I dont enjoy listening to but understand how others could or see quality that I can appreciate. Likewise everyone has those guilty pleasure artistssongs where we know theyre bad but love them anyway. In either case there is something about the music that we find good whether an infectious melody or wellconstructed lyrics or a wailing solo.Which returns me to trap. I find nothing about it aesthetically or musically appealing. I cant relegate it to Im not into it but can see why others do because I cant see why others like it which is why I turn to you Reddit. My objections are as follows Minimalism works against it. Minimalism in music is not always bad. I listen to other Electrohouse or DnB artists who use it to great effect. It creates a great tensionandrelease element to a song and when used well is orgasmic. This tension is a staple in the Trap sound replacing the forceful Dubstep drop for a super low drone with a high minimalistic melody generally speaking. On an subjective level this is musical blue balls but I think I can make a case for this on a more objective level. The reason the EDM staple of builddrop works is because of the tensionrelease cycle. Its like those amusement park rides that take you up feet and then well drop you. The exhilaration and force of the drop is sharpened by the slow buildup. Trap on the other hand employs an almost identical build and then the contrasted lack of sound at the drop serves as a different kind of experience. Imagine if instead of dropping the full feet the ride drops you feet. You dont expect the stop and theres this juxtaposition of released tension and even more anticipation. Trap as a genre embraces this latter example as its core never rleasing the tension fully. As a result instead of effectively building a proper tensionrelease cycle Trap leaves the listener unfulfilled.Possible rebuttal to The amusement park model doesnt work for Trap. In that case what is a better model with which to consider Trap? Absence of complexity. Im not looking for Mozart the DJ. Just something that gives the illusion of compositional knowhow. note melodies are firstly boring and secondly a sign that the producer has no musical talent. I would like skill in my music. Trap as a genre feeds the instrumentalfetishist argument that electrobic music takes no skill because they dont play a real instrument. EDM can do so much more and Ive heard it do so much more. Just never in this genre.Possible rebuttal to aYoure just being a snob and using it as an excuse for your subjective dislike. Possibly but I dont think so. Even if the bar were set really low like One Direction low maybe the best choruses of Trap that are distinctly Trap not simply elements of other EDM genres which automatically set the majority of trap above D could surpass them in terms of quality. Maybe. bOther genres have plenty of unremarkable musical complexity. Agreed however no genre aside from Ambient Drone makes melodic simplicity a defining feature of the genre itself. c Simplicity is not always bad. Agreed. Some composers use simplicity very well and for a variety of aesthetic effects. My argument is that Trap does not.Its likely that I wont enjoy Trap music after this thread but I do want to understand those that do like it and if they like it whether they actually think it constitutes quality music. Thank you.Example This is a fairly standard in my mind example of Trap elements. steady drone with highhats composing the background for a melody of lets face it one note with some ornaments.Example Remix also including elements mentioned above. Better than most but only just.Example Changing up the formula a little with this one. The downtempo nature brings something different to the table and its minimalism actually contributes to its overall feel. Definitely not the norm though.Example songs that could serve as an adequate standard for what I mean by Trap. Note that my argument is not that all sound the same but that the similar features are the defining features of Trap and that those features in themselves constitute poor music.',\n",

Since the idea of it negatively contributing to society would be an extremely complex issue that couldnt be covered by the lengths of your post and mine combined Im going to assume you mean bad as in unappealingunenjoyable.It seems that a lot of what you seem to believe is objective about the quality or enjoyability is instead your preferences being projected onto to all perspectives that exist this is the problem in your arguments. I think I can make a case for this on a more objective level. The reason the EDM staple of builddrop works is because of the tensionrelease cycle.Works in what way? Appealing to you appealing to everyone or appealing to the audience?EDM isnt loved by everyone so it cant be the second option. Trap clearly has an audience so the third is out as it working wouldnt distinguish it from trap as your post suggests. Its like those amusement park rides that take you up feet and then well drop you. The exhilaration and force of the drop is sharpened by the slow buildup.Yes but the experience is personal and to what extent it is enjoyed subjective. Some people even though they are a visibly smaller group really just enjoy this initial buildup. Trap on the other hand employs an almost identical build and then the contrasted lack of sound at the drop serves as a different kind of experience. Its different. This doesnt mean its bad. Imagine if instead of dropping the full feet the ride drops you feet. You dont expect the stop and theres this juxtaposition of released tension and even more anticipation.Except the fans do expect the stop and its the restrained feeling of it that may be appealing as you still hold some of that builtup tension while the music continues. As a result instead of effectively building a proper tensionrelease cycle Trap leaves the listener unfulfilled.What do you mean by unfulfilled? Do you mean that all of the tension was not properly removed? The trap fans still feel fulfilled at the end but they achieve this by seeking a different experience from you you expect a build and release while they expect to retain the build beyond the peak maybe because they enjoy the tense feeling as you enjoy the feeling of being thrilled.Our experience of tension and thrills is completely subjective in itself so the perceived quality of different tracks in EDM which is mainly based around pursuing a certain experience that audience finds enjoyable this extends to a large proportion of music would be subjective. Absence of complexity. Im not looking for Mozart the DJ. Just something that gives the illusion of compositional knowhow.First why?Second isnt the use of simple strings of notes and rhythm to create a precisely defined experience in itself demonstrative of some compositional knowhow?Third this is what youre looking for which doesnt necessarily apply to everyone or to an objective gauge of quality. note melodies are firstly boringSubjective and secondly a sign that the producer has no musical talent.Talent is unlearned skill. I suppose you mean to say skill in which case I addressed this above. I would like skill in my music.How would you gauge the skill of a composer?Also this part is about what youd like. Trap as a genre feeds the instrumentalfetishist argument that electrobic music takes no skill because they dont play a real instrument.Really the instrumetalfetishist argument isnt a valid argument as what is a real instrument is completely arbitrary so whoever uses the argument is trying to rationalise their stubborn view. This means that whatever supposedly strengthens this argument actually doesnt because there is no argument. EDM can do so much more and Ive heard it do so much more. Just never in this genre.Personal experience subjective etcJust so you know Im not a fan of trap either.'},\n",

Actually you should spend some free time in doing just that if you are passionate about computer science and wanting to work in the field. And yes you can become a working programmer without having gone to university. But there are chance that you would miss out on some knowledge if you took that way.What the university is supposed to teach you is things many people have problems wrapping their heads around on their own. The logic and maths behind the programming. Not only that an algorithm works but why and how it works. A better knowledge and understanding of time and space complexity. Those are things people who teach themselves programming often seem to not pay attention to but which could come in handy.Another thing university is good for is networking. Your professors often work on actual computer science projects know people outside of university etc. you have four years to make a good impression be noticed. This extends to your classmates too. Being on good footing with people who might end up in the same industry but still all over the country is helpful. A friend of mine is using networking perfectly.

In college you have professors to help you get started and guide you through your thought processes peers to share your misery with and deadlines to make sure that you actually do the work. In the real world you are expected to look at the problem and develop a solution with the tools you have if your solution isnt good enough or you dont get it done on time well sorry somebody else is getting paid today.

Either your school is terrible or youre just not open to learning via the schoolclass structure. The reason you are given grades is because science is hard and students get things wrong.

       "  'arguments': 'Things to consider Those that I list on this post or in the comments are not my personal opinions just examples Im using unless I specifically state otherwise. I am not implying that the karma system should be removed or changed in any way I am simply saying that the karma system is the reason behind this. I firmly believe that having any sort of controversial opinion on Reddit is absolutely pointless and that the karma system is the main reason that is. The karma system allows one group to impose their beliefs on another with a whose side has more people who believe in this kind of numbers game. It always comes down to the fact that if the hivemind does not completely agree with your opinion your post will simply be buried deep within the bellows of the website and very little discussion will ever be had about it. Every Redditor knows that saying things that are generally unpopular with the majority of Reddit can mean an infinite amount of karma loss and possible continuous harassment. For example I remember a while back I do not have a link sorry. of a Redditor who posted something negative about Jennifer Lawrence. He made a meme soon after explaining something about it and then I eventually seen a Bad Luck Brian meme about him several days later because every comment he ever made or close to was downvoted into oblivion and he was harassed nonstop. His having a different opinion than the hivemind pretty much destroyed his account. Something very similar happened to me once before as well when I was new to the website. I posted what is generally a very unpopular opinion on Reddit before I was aware that it was because it is my personal belief. The topic was the legalization of marijuana for recreational uses and I was hoping for some discussion about it because I had asked a question to another Redditor as to why he felt the way he did towards it being legalized something I am personally against. I asked why he was prolegalization stated one reason I am against it and told him that his story had made my day. I did not attack his opinion I did not downvote him I upvoted him in fact because I enjoyed the story he wrote and I had no ill intentions whatsoever. Instead of some sort of civil discussion and my question being answered what I got was overly defensive comments not from him he did not reply calling me an idiot just for having that opinion downvotes that never seemed to end on that comment until I deleted it being attacked for every little thing related or otherwise and no real discussion to be had. I was practically forced to delete that comment because of the nonstop harassment if I wanted to continue using my account. My comment also was not to just incite an argument seeing as how there was others saying how it should just be legalized in the other comments already and this was not a marijuana related subreddit I.E rtrees. It was raskreddit and the topic of legalization had already been present before I had posted that I was against it.Reddit is supposed to be a discussion board and website where people share their opinions something nobody should be harassed for. Harassment of those with controversial opinions continues and is something I regularly see being mentioned on subreddits like roffmychest. If so few are willing to truly have a discussion and instantly take to this numbers game then what point is there in even posting your opinion if its not what the collective wants to see? The karma system buries what you said or posted essentially making it absolutely pointless.

       "  'arguments': 'Note I originally posted this in rexplainlikeimfive but I realized it would probably be better suited to here.Ive been thinking about the concept of a month. Is there any reason for it to exist? It seems like it would be simpler to have something like Day instead of February . At the moment the year is split up into twelve chunks but theyre not quite equal their lengths appear to have no logical order aside from summing to or and one of them has a different length every years. Whenever we refer to the frequency of an event as say once a month we could just as easily say that its once every days.Clarification Im saying that as it is once a month is very imprecise anyway since months have varying lengths. For anything that can be this arbitrary once every days works just as well.Leap years would also be extremely simple instead of adding a day to a particular month a day could just be added to a year. The year would then go up to Day instead of Day .Heres an example of why I think a calendar without months would be easier.Suppose its Saturday September th or Day . Lets suppose I wanted to figure out what day of the week December th Day would be.To figure it out in my head using the current months system I would have to go through the following procedure which could probably be reduced a bit but not greatly is a Saturday is a Saturday is a Tuesday is a Tuesday is a Tuesday is a Friday is a Friday is a Friday is a Saturday is a Saturday is a FridayOn the other hand if I wanted to figure out the same thing using a numberedday system it would be simpleDay Day days days mod .Therefore Day is days later than a Saturday so its a Friday.Consider this answered but if you disagree about the last point feel free to change my view on that too Ill still be reading comments.',\n",

       "  'arguments': 'I dont believe humans are meant to be monogamous. Based on the fact that we used to be cave men and women and men would typically have multiple partners in order to pass their lineage on I believe that while we have clearly evolved from that biology has still framed us to struggle with monogamy. In many ways I think we have animalistic tendencies when it comes to interpersonal relationships and that people will always struggle with looking for someone better because of natural selection and all that jazz. Also testosterone is a powerful thing.Marriage for example is a social construct and legal contract more than anything. And whether married or not failed relationships and cheating is just way too prevalent to be coincidental. I think our bodies struggle with remaining loyal to one person even if we are emotionally complex enough to realize that this is wrong.While from an idealistic stance I think its awesome to think we could find one partner who is the one and successfully remain with them indefinitely I have a hard time believing that is indeed the case. Change my view.',\n",
       "  'counters': 'Firstly when was this mythical time when we were cave men and women and men would typically have multiple partners in order to pass their lineage on? What ancient world cultures are you referencing from where who were they that entire thing is a variation on a golden age myth. Ancient humans had complex relationships also so your assumptions here about ancient civilizations are oversimplistic and not really based on historical evidence. Some ancient folks had person relationships some didnt.Which is to say no humans are not meant to be monogamous. Humans are meant to survive period. Thats it. Which means humans are meant to be adaptable. Which means humans are meant to not only be adaptable as individuals but also as a speciesgroup. Which means some people will fall more on one side of a spectrum and others will fall more on the other.All of which is to say the natural state of humans appears to be to have there be a tension between the desire to partnerpair up and reproduce and the desire to still sex up people who are not your partner. Seems like a lot of what we choose to do with these desires is something that society has provided similar to how we dont just steal what our neighbor has just because we want it or have less but instead have learned to work together in ways that at least benefit the majority in certain ways. This is true in many domains with people our lot is to exist between a multiplicity of tensions of opposites. We want to be presentoriented to enjoy ourselves but we have to be futureoriented to maintain longevity and pastorientation can teach us a lot of things. Too much of any one and well be employing suboptimal living strategies. In a society some people can be too much one way and others too much the other and thats how everything gets done as long as people dont start fighting over it. Which they often do of course.Loyalty to one person isnt wrong just as screwing everyone we could possibly want also isnt wrong. Both benefit us just in different ways. Humans evolved to employ reason at least to some extent and so we can exercise that reason and try to sculpt the life and lifeview that we wish to use during the exceedingly brief time when were alive. So no humans arent meant to be monogamous. But nor are we meant to be polyamorous or whatever word you want to use to refer to having a multiplicity of partners. We are however able to do all of those things.That said youre all over the place. Cheating isnt coincidental its an indication of a relationship breakdown. It doesnt relate to evolutionary theory as much as a dynamic between two people. If someone wants to screw around they can break up or create an open relationship. What youre talking about is dishonesty and betrayal. Relationships fail a lot because yeah people are dishonest and wounded and theres a lot going on. The one has nothing to do with it. Thats romance movie talk. A good relationship has to do with being with someone you respect and love and are attracted to and all that to an adequate enough degree. And you could screw other people sure but maybe you do want to be with your partner so you willingly put that aside. Are there perhaps other more attractive people out there? Sure probably. But its about maturity and understanding that you have found someone good enough to spend your time with someone you can be happy with. And there are a multiplicity of such other humans in the world that would work with you and that you would work with. And so you find someone who you work well enough with and who works well enough with you and you create rules to establish a sense of emotional safety which for the majority of the population is monogamy. And thats another important point relationships are not only about sex. Emotional needs are even bigger in my experience. The desire to be with someone to not be alone to be known to have someone you know you can rely on all those things are benefits of relationships. On reddit we tend predominantly see the worst relationship moments the most dramatically messed up people and since the loudest population on here is the youngest population that year old demographic there is also a lot about sex which gives a lot of people the mistaken notion that motivation for sex really actually is the thing keeping people together. Its up there and its huge but its a revolving carousel of really crucial shit without which a lot of people feel their lives are the poorer for it.This is not to say that being someone who actively eschews monogamy means youre unhealthy. However it is a relatively small percentage of the population who can truly persist as polyamorous individuals. As I say humanity is all over the spectrum so these people are legitimately the way they are and thats fine. That too doesnt constitute an indictment of monogamy just as there being lots of dyedinthewool monogamists doesnt constitute an indictment of polyamory.'},\n",

Its possible to have empathy for people with experiences outside of your own but it is not possible to actually experience another persons perspective. Many people say they would behave in a certain way given a certain set of circumstances but when such circumstances arise they actually behave in very different ways. For instance I always said that if something happened to my ability to walk I would kill myself because I couldnt imagine going through life in a wheelchair. Now that I am facing this reality Im actually not all that keen to kill myself over it because its not as horrible as I imagined it would be.In this particular situation this surgery was an unnecessary procedure. As the article states there was no medical reason the surgery had to be performed at that time. It was completely possible to wait until the child signaled his own gender identity. Given that there are and year old biological boys wearing girls clothes and playing with Barbie dolls because theyve already identified a problem with their biological gender theres no reason to assume that such a surgery would have to wait until the child was years old. There are children taking drugs to slow the onset of puberty in order to reduce gender dysphoria. Nor is there any reason to assume that the child would be particularly attached to organs that he does not feel belong to him. Again youre looking at this from the perspective of a person who is not actually transgender or intersex.Someone did some research on these questions after interviewing intersex people and doctors who treat these patients.From the studyNote that this says assigned a gender but not have gender assignment surgery.As the article says I agree that its difficult for parents to make decisions about their infants future sex life. My parents had my brother circumcised even though their doctor told them it was medically unnecessary because they were worried that my brother would feel weird in later locker room andor sexual situations when most of his peers would also be cut statistically speaking.

For starters...youre implying theres a problem. Youre saying that these children needs to be fixed. And neither of those things are true. Ambiguous genitalia I put in quotes because genitals are not ambiguous you can definitely tell theyre genitals even if they dont fit what your view of genitalia should look like is not something that needs to be fixed. Genitalia is on a spectrum and no matter what it looks like surgically altering it is not something for a doctor to decide unless there is a serious medical reason for that to happen. Doctors arent perfect by any means and often make mistakes when doing surgeries like these. Surgery can lead to scar tissue nerve damage incontinence massive amounts of pain and potential upkeep for the rest of the persons life. I guarantee the majority of intersex people will tell you that they would rather have their fullfunctioning working genitalia no matter what it looked like then whatever it is the doctors tried to build. Im not speaking for trans people here because they may want to have surgery when theyre older and can fully understand what that means. Either way watch this video from the Interface Project. Genital mutilation surgeries happen in children because a doctor or parent are uncomfortable with something a little different and then assume that the child would grow up as a heterosexual male or female. As an intersex person myself it was assumed I was straight when doctors tried to build me a vagina and that my vagina needed to be larger because heaven forbid it wouldnt please my husband one day. Many doctors all over the world have assumed this same thing about people with intersex variations like mine forcing them into unnecessary surgeries that have caused a LOT of problems. I escaped the surgery and despite the fact that I am straight I have not needed the surgery at all. It was completely unnecessary and cosmetic much like the surgeries that are happening on other intersex kids. You say if the child identified as female we would not be discussing it. And youre right WE probably wouldnt be discussing it. But that doesnt mean the child wont be. We dont know how the surgery went and even if it went well the child would still have to be taking medicine and doing upkeep to keep their vagina in working condition thats assuming that they want to be having penetrative sex. You dont know what or who theyre going to be into when they grow up or how theyre going to identify. As a representative of many intersex communities If theres one thing I can change is your view in that last sentence. It IS inherently wrong to perform surgeries like these and if you dont listen to anyone else please hear it from people like me. P.S.

The stories from people who remember this stuff are horrible. Most will have a fear or distrust of the medical community as a whole thus potentially making them not see care when they need it.A lot of intersex people have no desire for surgery and accept that theyre a bit different. Theres no reason they cant live a healthy happy life.If you get it wrong they have to transition and if they dont know whats up with them they might not find out until far later in life. Trust me when I say one puberty sucks you dont want a second. Some changes cant be undone and the surgery may have compromised the tissue that could be used for surgery later on if they desire it. The reactions for an intersex person telling their family theyre transitioning is pretty much the same for trans people. They might accept it but theres always going to be a few who dont. The intersex condition means nothing and they will completely ignore it.You could make them infertile or force them on hormones for the rest of their lives.Over all there might be a few who are happy with the surgery and there might be a few who are just kinda ok with it but youre going to get far too many who are not ok with it for it to be worth doing and there is no reason to not wait till they can decide for themselves or at least partake in the conversation. I know a lot of people dont like letting a yr old decide thing like that but its sure as hell better then them getting no say at all. The idea that there is only male or female is a rather troublesome idea anyways and riddled with problems so why not let intersex kids shine? Theyre different but theres nothing bad about that and they shouldnt have to feel ashamed of it.'},\n",

       "  'counters': 'Disneys bread and butter prePixar at least is simplistic representations of good and evil. However complex the source material Disney distills these tales down to their simplest essence in order to engage their target audience which is children. At the time children are engaging in Disney mania they are also reading fables fairy tales and childrens chapter books with similar simplistic features. Thats not to say that there arent deeper or more complex messages to mine from this materialthere most certainly are. But we must ask ourselves what is actually penetrating the childs mind. Its difficult to answer this question without engaging with actual children. As I ponder it I think its almost a chicken and egg questiondo children learn stereotypes from Disney that they later reenact in their real lives creating a selfreinforcing loop? Or do children enjoy Disney films blissfully unaware of stereotypes that they only recognize later as they are exposed to more media history literature etc.?For instance as an adult I was able to easily suss out the races of various voice actors portraying good and evil characters as well as identify the origin of accents put on by the voice actors to flesh out the characters. But as a child? I dont know if I was sophisticated enough to draw such connections and I was the kind of kid who was reading Nathaniel Hawthorne in the th grade.I wont argue with you about Disneys racism stereotypes or gender role problems because they are real. Im just not sure that Disney is actually teaching children anything about these roles when so many of the stereotypes they rely on also call for an adult understanding of these stereotypes. For instance a kid watching TLK knows that the hyenas are the bad guys but Disney reinforces their badness by using Nazi symbolism. A six yearold doesnt know from Nazi symbolism. The actors portraying the hyenas are all black but Scar is of course a white dude. Do kids actually know this? Do they draw the conclusion that black people are evil from this? If they know Scar is actually an old white dude why wouldnt they draw the conclusion that white people are evil? Or that anyone can be evil? The crows from Dumbo are obviously black guys but does a modern yearold get that these crows are meant to represent black dudes from the s? Do they get that the crows actually subvert stereotypes The paper I link here quotes Leonard Maltin and I agree with him.I think that this is an important distinction to make. The black crows in Dumbo are a far cry from the black pickaninny centaur polishing the white centaurs hooves in Fantasia. They are friends to Dumbo and teach him how to fly after rockin out a fancy tune.And finally I dont think its fair to single out Disney or movies for children in particular. Avatar was one of the most racist piles of crap Ive ever seen but it made like a bajillion dollars at the box office. Everyone I know loved The Help but I found myself chafing at white Skeeter swooping in to empower a bunch of oppressed black women. Do these movies teach adults the wrong lessons about colonialism or the resistance to racial oppression in the South? Or are they just forms of entertainment infuriating to those who peer a little deeper below the surface? Are kids just different because theyre kids and therefore impressionable?'},\n",

The second the average Japanese individual is no longer willing to do this then the whole system will collapse so the system is only as sustainable as long as trust and contentment remains high.Japan cannot be said to be thriving. Its virtually impossible for the average individual to start a business. The cozy attitude between government and business leads to regulatory capture that freezes out competition from either Japanese Entrepreneurs or foreign firms while weakening the effectiveness of regulation to protect the people as seen by the Fukushima disaster. Its operating largely on inertia at this stage and it is holding together as well as can be expected with some pretty significant advantages of almost complete cultural uniformity and uniquely favorable trade and geopolitical conditions.Clearly Japan isnt a Zimbabwe or Venezuela. But it was once a rapidly expanding economy that grew to be the worlds second biggest. The contrast between Japan of the s and the Japan of today just as striking and sever as the trajectory of Zimbabwe or Venezuela.

I believe it was on of the biggest shocks to my personal views on the world. All my life I suffered from lack of sexualsocial success I wasnt confident I didnt know how to deal with people around me and I basically reverted to being a nice guy which is something people amp popculture advocates through advice movies selective presentation by the media and so forth. When I was introduced to the PUA community years ago and eventually TRP a few months ago it was the first time in my life I was given helpful advice on how to become someone who can actually make it in todays society in terms of being socialsexual. Those communities taught me about confidence staying true to myselfself embracing my sexuality and most of all become the best version of myself and aim for the stars in a way that is actually applicable to the real world and not in the form of some cliched advice that people oblivious to those concepts could possibly grasp and implement.I do agree with a lot of statements regarding TRP making generalizations about women to a point of dehumanizing them. But on the other hand there is no other community that gives you genuine advice on how to become that successful person you always wanted to be and reach your goals in life and I sincerely believe that someone who will ignore the MRAoriented side of TRP and focus on the advice they give on selfimprovement as proven mostly true by peoples Field Reports will prosper beyond his imagination and theres no competition in that field. The world is a harsh place full of mostly egocentric people that will not reach out for people with that kind of weaknesses and one must seek it out in places like TRP to have a chance of actually bettering theirselves.The reason I believe that is by looking at facts Before being exposed to the PUA community and TRP I had no courage to even talk to a girl I had interest in was socially awkward and was made fun of most of my teenage years. This applies to a lot of men my age who you could see for a fact that didnt even know how to deal with those kind of issues and suddenly its like they swallowed a magic pill.After Learned to take the initiative and lead the interaction as directly suggested by those communities take responsibility for sexual escalation which doing only halfassed while not being experienced always turned girls off and finally lost my virginity.

Its not original or new its not some grand epiphany. Its the same tired old selfhelp advice wrapped in a different package.Ill give you one right now The Military. Hell Ill give you two Competitive Sports.A community of supporting people all collaborating towards a common goal with an emphasis on personal achievement? Of course it feels like a magic pill. But its no different than a college fraternity or an after school activity club or the military or competing in team sports or anything else. Its great that you finally found something that helped you grow up a bit.But theres nothing magical or special about TRPPUA communities. They dont have anything unique or special about their advice or their methods. Hell I would argue its especially limiting since the primary drive and focus of those communities is basically sexual conquest.Many make it their whole life eschewing deeper relationships and focusing on numbers.It seems glamorous when your younger but man...nobody thinks the year old hanging out at the college night club hitting on drunk girls is cool. And thats where TRPPUA takes you if you follow it part and parcel.Now you can cherry pick like many do.But what are you cherry picking? Be confident Believe in yourselfMaybe throw in Take some initiativeBut those arent unique to that community.I could take your entire post and replace it with Tony Robbins or shit Any of these mother fuckers or any of these books and it would read largely the same.Thats the reason for the broad dismissal of TRP and the PUA community.

That is seen across cultures and even across species. Simply put men want sex more than women they just do. Sure or year old boys may not have the mental andor emotional capability to fully consent to sex but pretending that boys at that age dont want sex is completely disingenuous and so is pretending that girls by and large are as driven by sexual motives as boys.

So what does that mean for the street harassment law? First while the goal is worthwhile it probably isnt a compelling government interest. Street harassment doesnt threaten public safety and rarely constituted a true threat to someones safety. And the law already covers the most severe cases in regular harassment laws. Id also like to point out that sexual harassment is a grounds for a lawsuit but isnt a crime. You cant get a ticket or criminal charges for sexual harassment. So this proposal is much different from those laws.'},\n",

North Korea is the epitome of cruel and unusual punishment placing people in concentration camps for the rest of their lives and the next three generations after them where they have insufficient access to food no access to information no entertainment virtually no interaction with other prisoners and virtually no free time from hard slavelike physical labor.The view that you have expressed is that anyone who goes to a country and breaks one of its laws even unknowingly or accidentally deserves this form of punishment and the only reason youve stated for that is that one could have known beforehand what one was in for.If you honestly believe that then you shouldnt mind if your home country also started administering such punishments or you would be inconsistent. After all here in the western world we clearly lay out the fate that awaits anyone who breaks the law so you always know what youre in for when you commit a crime right?But you know that European and North American countries do not in general make use of such inhumane sentences. Why is that? Its because their population largely believes that as human beings we do not deserve certain kinds of treatment even after committing a crime. The kinds of gruesome punishments Im thinking of are considered to be in violation of human rights and criminals are humans too. Logically you dont stop being a human when you go to another country so it would be a doublestandard to say that a certain punishment would be deserved over there but not over here.Now most of the population of most western countries believes this even about criminals who have committed heinous acts against their fellow humans. Your however is not even about heinous crimes but about political activism and religious proselytization both acts in which other humans arent even being hurt. Any reasonable human being in their right mind would not consider a jail sentence to be a commensurate punishment for such an action much less for it to be deserved.

It also reeks of a there are starving kids in Africa type of argument.Yelling shit at strangers on the street does not seem like a normal social dynamic. In fact it seems rather rude. Personally I think it is more polite to not try to stop strangers to have a conversation with them. You have no idea if they are busy or not in the mood for casual conversation.Theres a time and a place for that. Shouting sexual compliments at strangers on the street is neither the time nor the place.It will tell wellmeaning guys that think catcalling is acceptable that it isnt. Furthermore it will encourage guys to call out other guys that are catcalling and tell them to stop. And yes there are obviously going to be many guys who dont give a fuck and will still catcall but that doesnt mean that we shouldnt try to lower the amounts of catcalling.The point of the NYC video is to show that many women do not enjoy what you are labeling as compliments or greetings and that it makes them feel extremely uncomfortable. I think its best to accept and respect that and therefore work to discourage such behavior rather than argue semantics and try to deny and trivialize the experiences that many women have.This is a total strawman argument.

Brute forcing is not an issue as long as you limit log in attempts to something reasonable that wouldnt affect the user like .

Having timeout after X attempts is merely just one in many layers of protecting you and far from the most effective.The other reason for having a longer password and allowing for more characters is due to what I was mentioning about other ways. If an attacker can obtain a list of hashed encoded passwords your six character alphanumeric password is going to take a computer all of maybe an hour or two. Even that is presuming youre using a random six characters and not a word as many attackers use specialized dictionaries depending on what they are trying to get into.Every character you introduce adds some more protection and adding a wider variety of characters adds an exponential amount more literally. A computer doesnt really care if you used a word or random gibberish..its all or to it. Its about computing time. Everything is crackable its all about making it take an unreasonable amount of time so that they dont try or it buys enough time to realize there was a breach and people can change their passwords.There is no one way to stop attacks and all the security team and yourself can do is build up layers of protection to make it as difficult as possible. Having a weak layer makes having other strong ones meaningless.

Im a working director in television amp commercials and I also do a lot of web video and sometimes short films. Im not in any way a leader in the field of filmmaking but I have a dozen years of experience in this industry and I think enough perspective to speak on issues of what matters to a film generally. So anyways my point I think you have it backwards. A good actor can make a script production editor etc look good. And a bad actor can bring down the best of everything. And Ive worked with a lot of bad actors. Im a tech guy I did VFX for years I build my own post production hardware Im a camera nerd and can gossip ad nauseum about sensor charts. I like engineering and the structured mindset of editing. But I know the limits of cameras set design effects color and what they cant bring to a film.Even the lowest paid grip on set can tell when a good actor is on. They can make scenes work that just shouldnt and there are plenty of those floating around out there. Having a quality actor on set gives you options as a filmmaker because they can adapt give you new ideas play a scene big to fill a room you didnt have the budget to set dress play it close to let you cover with a closeup for a matching action you couldnt get yesterday solve a script problem with a look or a physical affectation the list goes on and on. Im rambling but this is it as a lowtier professional filmmaker who usually has a budget handed down to him there is no camera light location support or extra asset worth more to me than a good actor. I can say this definitively because usually talent is the first thing cut from my budgets because you are not the first person with this idea and business people dont like things that cant be quantified so I have more than enough experience with bad or mediocre acting and what it can do to a production. TLDR A bad actor will paint you into a corner as a filmmaker a good actor will set you free and help you make the best film possible.'},\n",

Making them both for both genders will require a massive amount of work and money. Women need more stalls than men. This means that bathrooms would have to look quite different installing large amounts of stalls and urinals. Maybe the answer is to get rid of urinals and just install lots of stalls since everyone uses those theres actually a club near me that does that and the bathroom is like the same size as the dancefloor and still always has a massive queue. Its tricky to see how small restaurants or existing buildings could really solve these issues. In existing buildings and future buildings with no segregation but multiple bathrooms it is likely that one bathroom will be more conveniently located than another. At the moment this means that one gender maybe has a bit further to walk but it does limit the traffic to of people per bathroom. People are gross in bathrooms everywhere. If one bathroom is more convenient it might get of the foot traffic can you imagine how gross that would be?And the main issue with your OP is your final point places susceptible to potential harassment should probably segregate. So what now you see a segregated bathroom you know youre likely to get harassed in this establishment?

Directors cost more and are the first people to be laid off when there is a restructuring. I cannot take my achievements to the grave. To me life is not about achievements but about experiences. Achievements are just a means to an end which is having awesome experiences. There is a case to be made that social status itself is an experience worth pursuing but corporate titles dont really impress the people closest to me. They only impress people I dont like and dont care about. There certainly are situations where hard work is worth it but working for a corporation is not one of them. Most of the fruits of your labor will go to the shareholders and not to your salary. For an employee the returns diminish very sharply in the corporate word. A higher position can mean more autonomy but it also means managing people which is not something I enjoy. And since I do mostly contract work I already have some autonomy in choosing the projects I will work on.Having said all that I cannot get rid of the feeling that Im somehow letting myself down.

You wouldnt think about whether or not to tell her about it.You were motivated enough by this quandary to post about it on Reddit. So Im going to say that it must sometimes play on your mind. Probably not very often any more as you say youve dealt with it had the therapy done the talking and moved on but it does come back. After all years of therapy is a big chunk of your life. Being in therapy isnt something that just happens an hour a week when you see the therapist its a big deal beforehand and afterwards it permeates the rest of your life. So thats a couple of years that you dedicated towards getting over the emotions unpicking the desires getting to the root of why you did these things and learning how to stop. It must have been quite a process. I bet you have memories of the big breakthrough sessions maybe where you broke down crying or remembered a longforgotten thing. Maybe those memories surface from time to time. Maybe memories of the things you did surface sometimes. Its difficult to forget.So now lets get you into a relationship. A wonderful woman comes into your life. You learn about each other find lots that you relate to share things with each other become more and more intimate. She tells you some dark things about her past things that are hard to tell others. She tells you them because she feels safe and because she wants you to know her. She wants you to know everything about her past so that you can better understand her present. She needs that validation that acceptance that forgiveness and youre happy to give it to her because you love her and she makes you happy. She cries and you start to comfort her but it reminds you somehow of your therapy or the women you touched. The painful memory makes you pull away and seeing the pain in your eyes she asks you what is it?Oh nothing its not important or relevantDo you really think thatll fly? Shes sharing everything with you and everything you share brings you closer. The closer you get the more intimacy you feel and the more like you want to get married. But every time this black hole from your past crosses your mind it will have an effect. Hiding these things takes energy. It will keep coming up unpredictably and she will notice. Some little change will happen. We pick up on these patterns in peoples behaviour especially at vulnerable times.She will notice and try to probe. Shell see a sore spot and like any good masseur shell want to get to the centre of it because thats the only way to help it. But youll close down pull away. The more she probes the more youll try and deflect. How long do you think you can keep that up before deflecting turns into defense? And when it turns into defense then that makes her the attacker. Why does she keep attacking me?!Feeling attacked like this can lead to anger it can lead to a lot of things. You will need to feel in control again and who knows what lengths you will go to in order to get it. One idea would be to shut down any conversations that might touch on her emotions so that she doesnt trigger your memories. Or to avoid anything other than mundane every day topics. Or maybe to stop talking about the past.Soon enough this little unimportant little detail from your past is protected by big BEWARE signs and massive metal walls. Barbed wire everywhere. Maybe shell learn to just not go there. Shell definitely know there is a secret. But when the defenses are so elaborate you cant just stop trying to get through them. Not with a partner. With a friend you could but this is something important enough to warrant all of those defenses so it must be important to you and she wants to know everything about you because she loves you and wants to support you and wants to help. And you cant let her in.Let her in let her see whats behind the walls. Its the only choice youll have. You say now it isnt relevant or important because youve probably not had to defend this secret and so the walls are probably hidden and inconsequential to your daily life. Having a loving intimate relationship will change that. For it to be really fulfilling there needs to be a twoway sharing. A secret will always find ways to make itself known and the more you try and hide it the more ways it will find to alert her of its existence.I would hope that by the time you understand this youll also understand that telling her about it will be a good thing. If this is the woman youre going to marry that were talking about then this wont destroy anything. Its not bigger than the love youve built up. Its not stronger than the bond between you. If we trust someone with our deepest darkest secrets and there is love then those secrets will be received with love and light will be reflected back.I hope you find someone to trust with this.

We need to accept two things universal vegetarianism isnt going to happen soon and if it happens in the future it will probably be due to good quality lab meet or some other fundamental changes in society. Second an individual not eating meat makes zero difference almost. Unless you live on a farm or directly hunt your meat not a single animal is saved. By the time you reject a burger your rejection pretty much only affects you. However that doesnt mean there is no reason to be a vegetarian or to care. One reason is if you are personally so disturbed by knowing what you are eating that you genuinely dont want meat. That is great but we can agree that is a personal reason that might help better you as an individual but wont help the world. Only remaining reason would be contributing to a trend. If restaurants keep getting vegetarian requests they might actually start ordering less meat and that will culminate and the difference might be felt. However it is more likely that while they will develop a better vegetatarian offer the need for meat will only keep increasing with the growing number of population and contributing to the trend of not eating meat at all wont do any difference. However there is a different trend that many meat eaters are getting behind as well and that is caring about where your meat is from and whether the animals were ethically treated. Many people arent able to give up meat but they do care about animals. If you go behind this trend you might contribute to making a difference. A restaurant that would otherwise just leave their meat as it is and make a vegetarian option after hearing enough people ask about where the meat is from might totally change their meat suppliers. That is a big difference. The trend would push farms to be more humane if selling otherwise becomes difficult. For a local place being the fifth regular who cares about this could even be enough to make a difference. It just seems like the next realistic goal is getting behind demanding better treatment for animals and that can be achieved if the intended consumers of the meat make these demands.

If your answer is also yes wouldnt such change have come about as the result of many individuals decisions to drop meat thus showing that individual decisions to drop meat can make a difference? I totally disagree. Vegetarian consumers are still consumers obviously theyre no longer of interest to a company like Perdue but theyre of interest to any other company looking to make a profit. See the proliferation of vegetarianvegan convenience foods in the past decade as evidence of that.And as far as fighting for something achievable through what theyre doing vegetariansvegans help make vegetarianismveganism more socially acceptable and a more accessible option for everyone else thus making it easier for others to reduce or eliminate their meat consumption.'},\n",

Im not saying that we should all be dicks to each other but what I am saying is that in the long run there will be no evidence of someone acting either way. Most people will be completely forgotten within years of their death. I used to believe that I should strive to be one of the lucky few who should rise above and do something so great that they are remembered indefinitely. Nowadays I realize that this was a stupid thought because on a long enough timeline everything that everyone has ever done will be lost. When the sun explodes or even if some of us survive that when some sort of cosmic event destroys every part of the universe we are a part of. OR even simply when the human race becomes extinct or if we evolve when all of the branches of the tree that came from us falls to extinction. After that I felt that helping people mattered because even if I couldnt be remembered I could still have an effect on peoples lives in a positive manner and that has to count for something however if everyone who you helped is one day going to be long gone and every inkling of evidence that you or anyone you ever came into contact with even existed will be gone from the universe then what is the point? How does anything matter?That being said I recognize that if nothing matters than perhaps because of that fact maybe just maybe everything is important. Perhaps every single blade of grass moment in time leaf in the wind is infact important. This is the point of view that I would like to adopt but right now it seems that it takes too much faith and not enough logic for me to take the step into this mindset. If anyone has this mindset or has someway for me to rationalize this view please feel free to comment.Lastly I would like to keep this thread on topic. I realize that i made certain religiousnonreligious assumptions and would not like this to become a religious debate. Moreover I recognize that my thoughts here are extremely depressing but I am not here to debate my psychological state of mind. I am seeking help for this depression already and am simply here to discuss this philosophical viewpoint.',\n",
       "  'counters': 'It is true that from a scientific point of view there is no purpose or meaning to anything. But the idea that everything can be revealed through science is itself unscientific because we are not sure whether we as humans even have the cognitive ability to comprehend the universe and nature as it exists independent of our limited perception. We could be like ants living in an anthill inches off the shoulder of a highway. Those ants will never know what it is that they are living next to because they dont have the cognitive ability to know. We are the ants and reality is the highway.The few surviving huntergatherer cultures all have one thing in common They see meaning and purpose in everything around them. And as they are fully incorporated into their respective ecosystems they are participants in that meaning and purpose. As our ancestors adopted agriculture and civilization their spiritual leaders took the meaning and purpose out of the natural world and consolidated it into a few humanlike Gods who live in some otherworldly realm. As time went on those few Gods became one God and now some scientists like Richard Dawkins seek to take that one God who for so many encompasses meaning and purpose and turn it off completely. He wants people instead to create their own purpose and meaning through studying science or music or art. But as you point out these pursuits are ultimately unfulfilling. We humans evolved under certain conditions. Our notion of meaning purpose morality etc developed under those conditions and make little sense when taken and applied to circumstances that are as distant from those conditions as ours are today. For millions of years humans and the now extinct ancestors from which our species evolved lived in small tribal bands taking what we needed from the natural world. It was in these conditions that we developed our notion of meaning and morality. We are now trying to apply those notions to a world of mass industrial production a world that depends not in seeing the natural world as having innate meaning and purpose but seeing the natural world as being nothing but soulless resources for us to exploit for our own selfish ends. This is of course why religion was created to replace primitive animism in the first place. People cannot destroy their own land bases by converting it completely to human use unless they see it as dead lifeless matter that exists only for humans to use.Its hard for us to see much meaning and purpose in the natural world because we are so far removed from it. We spend so much time on these computers we are even becoming too far removed from one another. But if you do wish to see purpose and meaning my advice is to make an effort to find it in the world in which we evolved the notion of purpose and meaning in the first place and that is the life that makes you possible. Because you can exist without churches synagogues and the Hadron Collider. But you cannot exist without abundant clean water clean air or your family or friends.'},\n",

But I dont think the consequences will be as dire as are portrayed for humanity. In the following most of my source material is going to come from the IPCC which is I think a fairly good source for data on this and if anything has an institutional bias in the direction of warning of dire consequences.There are fourthree avenues that I think are of primary concern Sea level rise. The IPCC estimates a sea level rise in the range of .m over the next century. While thats not trivial its also not dire. Most coastal communities can manage that level of rise with levees and sea walls. Occasionally someone shows a map with a city like New York or Miami under a or meter rise in sea levels but the IPCC estimates give that a very low probability of happening. Drought and other negative impacts on agricultural production. I do not deny that some areas will see reduced rainfall but I dont think that can be true for everywhere indeed it would seem like higher aggregate temperatures would result in more atmospheric water vapor and more aggregate rainfall. So while some areas may be negatively impacted others will be positively impacted. Further weve been getting progressively more efficient agriculturally as time goes on. Across the world the amount of agricultural land per capita has been falling for decades and in developed nations where population growth is slow is falling in absolute terms. See pg. in this IPCC report This other report on the impact of climate change on crop output says with whats described as medium confidence that Severe weather events. While I dont deny that global warming can cause more severe weather events such as hurricanes I question whether this is a very dire consequence. As our weather forecasting improves and our disaster preparedness improves the loss of life from weather events falls. Even a very bad storm like Katrina was not nearly as devastating to human life as a storm with no warning years before. Further the IPCC expresses low confidence page of that source that the number of tropical cyclones is measurably impacted by climate change. Its a plausible hypothesis but not one that seems to have been proven yet.So the reason I am looking to see my view possibly changed on this is that I often see people proposing dire consequences and accordingly drastic action of the type that will massively impact standards of living especially among people in developing nations where energy is an enormous part of peoples daily budgets. I dont see the consequences of warming as being severe enough to justify those drastic measures and would like to know if theres something Im missing. Also Im primarily concerned with the impact on humans. While certainly we have to live in the natural environment and so it matters that the environment is in decent shape I see it as more an instrumentality to human wellbeing not an end in itself.For a bit of background Im not a climate scientist and dont have any particular area of expertise in this though I do have a fairly high base level of scientific knowledge and am open to fairly technical rebuttals.',\n",

The concern for me is ocean acidification which is happening now and everywhere although most noticeably in my area of the world Puget Sound PNW. I wrote this undergrad paper on the subject if you would like to check it out and I pretty much paraphrase myself below.The wiki page goes into more detail with the chemistry of it all. Basically the ocean absorbs CO at an increased rate causing the pH of the water to decrease becoming more acidic. This combined with higher temperatures than marine organisms are used to makes it hard for creatures to build structures out of calcium.Calciumbuilding organisms include crustaceans crab lobster etcsnailsshellfishcoralsturtles and essentially anything with a shell but more imporantly calcium structures form the majority of the body of organisms like diatoms and other planktons Planktonic organisms are the very bottom of the food web in the ocean which makes them a foundation of the food web for the planet. If plankton numbers fall so do fish and everything that feeds on fish so essentially everything. On that note about of humans rely on seafood as their primary source of food protien If that market falls through all of those people have to find a new way to eat not to mention the crashing economies of any coastal countries that export seafood As a case study this oyster farming operation was one of the first to ring the alarm bell about acidification ruining their business. This one too And this one And so on.In addition to being a food source for humans the ocean is also beautiful and ecotourism is a major source of income for many coastal countries. With coral reefs on their way to extinction that industry will also die. Im not saying that global warming is the ONLY cause for the oceans current spiraling decline but I am saying that if the ocean dies it will never ever come back the way it should be.'},\n",

Plenty of companies make their money on high margin goods which is totally fine for luxury items that you dont have to buy. So what if a high fashion house or highend manufacturer charges you far more than the cost to assemble the item you dont need it and can buy it from a commodity maker instead. Your choice to buy or not corrects their pricing.Yet you can have large companies with healthy competition that are good for consumers but most of the profit is taken by the very top while wages for the average worker stagnate. That issue is best corrected by taxing the wealthy individuals at progressive rates rather than the company itself.

This is especially true if they are riding parallel with your driver side tires when you are making your checks and then they suddenly turn out to go around you when you go to open the door.. Pedestrians are expected to cross at crosswalks. Why? Because a driver cant be expected to monitor for pedestrians that are crossing at every part of the road from every direction so we put the crosswalks at certain parts of the roads so that the drivers know where to expect pedestrians. Similarly its just as reasonable to say cyclists it is illegal for you to ride in the range of the doors because its not reasonable for drivers to expect you to be on simply any part of the road you want. You have to be where they expect traffic. They dont expect traffic right next to them when they are parked.. The cyclist for their own safety should not be riding in range of the doors.

In that situation you should simply take the lane which means that you ride in the centre of the lane so cars cannot pass you.

When a driver opens hisher door they are actively creating a situation that could be dangerous to themselves cyclists and other motorists.

       "  'titles': 'Being doorprized is the fault of the cyclist and cyclists should ride out of the range of doors.',\n",
       "  'arguments': 'Before I start I dont believe the above in all cases. Here are my two exceptions where I feel it is the fault of the dooropener. When the driver or passengers leave the vehicle when it is not in a proper parking spot. This is an illegal time to open the door anyway. Ive seen videos taken in New York of Taxi passengers being like this is the best spot to get out even though my Taxi is still in the middle of the road and then BAM. Door prize. This is the passengers fault.. When the driver opens the door into a marked bike lane without ensuring it is safe to do so. Note if the bike lane is positioned correctly it should never be within the door range of a parked car anyway so this situation should never exist but in reality it sometimes does exist. In the situations where it does exist I think that since the driver had to safely cross a marked bike lane to park their car it should be incredibly obvious that they need to be careful when opening their door on the way out. Thats why in this situation I think its the fault of the dooropener.Now on to my arguement. First off I do cycle on the road in a decent size city from time to time I used to do it full time so I am sympathetic to the plights of cyclists. Im not just an ignorant driver yelling from my spot of comfort.When I do ride I feel like I ride in a very safe patient predictable fashion. For example I dont pass by cars stopped at intersections because I dont feel that it is reasonable for them to be expected to see me. Ill sit directly behind them in line with their license plate and Ill let them do what they are doing without me making an erratic sudden unexpected pass. If I cant get directly behind them Ill still let them turn right or left or whatever without darting in front of them or near them. Cars have many blind spots and motorists cant be reasonably expected to check all of them all the time as well as monitor whats in front of them while making a turn. Not even the best mostattentive driver in the world could do so. Therefore I ride the way I do not only to keep myself safe but to make life easier and less stressful on motorists. Were all in this together.Doorprizing is probably the best example of cyclists having an attitude like People have to watch out for me in blank situation! Im not at all going to help them not make a mistake in blank situation just because Im not legally required to do so even though I could make the same mistake if I was them.. I understand how in the law it is written that a motorist must always open their door only when it is safe to do so. However I do not agree with this law as I do not feel that is it reasonable to blame a driver for opening his or her door into the path of a cyclist. Heres why. Even the best most attentive driver can miss a cyclist that is riding close enough to be doorprized. You can shoulder check mirror check or whatever. If a cyclist is within only a few feet of that side of your car and coming fast then they can be difficult to see until its too late. This is especially true if they are riding parallel with your driver side tires when you are making your checks and then they suddenly turn out to go around you when you go to open the door.. Pedestrians are expected to cross at crosswalks. Why? Because a driver cant be expected to monitor for pedestrians that are crossing at every part of the road from every direction so we put the crosswalks at certain parts of the roads so that the drivers know where to expect pedestrians. Similarly its just as reasonable to say cyclists it is illegal for you to ride in the range of the doors because its not reasonable for drivers to expect you to be on simply any part of the road you want. You have to be where they expect traffic. They dont expect traffic right next to them when they are parked.. The cyclist for their own safety should not be riding in range of the doors. They are doing something incredibly dangerous by riding in the door range of parked cars. If someone is doing something incredibly dangerous and someone hurts them as a result then often the person who hurts them should not be held at fault. I feel this is one of those situations.. Doorprizing a cyclist is a mistake anyone can easily make and its much easier to teach the cyclist not to ride in the doorprize lane than it is to teach the driver to ensure that every single time they open their door they need to spend the to seconds to do their best to make sure no cyclist is about to dangerously pass them even if the driver is preoccupied in a rush distracted by a child wanting to get out of the car etc.. Keep in mind youre not just teaching drivers youd have to teach children too because anyone can be opening one of the doors on that side of the car. Also I think youd be dishonest with me if you say that every single time you open your car door you are aware of whats next to you. Youre lucky that there was never an irresponsible cyclist those times that you did.Finally a cyclist might argue sometimes I need to cycle in the doorprize lane because theres not enough room for cars to pass me if I ride further to the left. In that situation you should simply take the lane which means that you ride in the centre of the lane so cars cannot pass you. This is legal you are still riding as far to the right as is safe to do so. If there are cars parked along the side of the road then the traffic on that road is likely slow enough that you will have little trouble taking the lane. If cars need to pass and youd prefer to not have them sit behind you you can move over into the doorprize lane and stop and wait until its reasonable to move into the regular traffic lane again. The hazard of riding near parked cars is incredibly obvious to the cyclist but the hazard of opening the car door is not so obvious to the dooropener because of human nature and what we are taught. The cyclist has more control over where heshe rides than we have control over our occasional forgetfulness or ignorance especially while doing something as innocent to our brain as opening a door no matter how hard we try or how responsible and cautious of a person we are.

       "  'counters': 'There is just not enough room on the roads. I live in a large British city and cycle often. I always try to be aware of the door length rule but if I was always that close to the centre of the road I would be holding cars up for hundreds of meters as it would be impossible for them to pass safely the majority of the time.Riding on that part of the road all the time forces the driver to drive at my pace behind me the majority have no where near the patience to do this or make a dangerously close pass. Id hope that people just take a second to check before opening the door its not just for cyclists too but motorbikes and widebadly aligned vehicles rather than forcing me to inconvenience and slow down many people aswell as opening myself up to recklessly fast and close overtaking.Ideally there would be seperate lanes but since thats not happening anytime soon Ill take people just being aware when opening road side. And to finish it should be in the interest of the person getting out into the middle of a road for their own safety.'},\n",

       "  'titles': 'The Government should neither regulate marriage All aspects of a Marriage should be determined by the individuals being Married and grounded in Civil Contracts',\n",
       "  'arguments': 'The title says it all. My nation the United States has a long history of controversy in regards to marriage. Up until interracial marriage was illegal in many states. Today I suspect most of the public supports the legality of interracial marriage. Since Plural marriages known mostly for the practices association with the Mormon church has been illegal. Then of course in recent years theres been the controversy over gay marriage George W. Bush putting opposition into law and over course his successor Barack Obama pushing in the opposite direction. Personally I just dont see why these issues are any business of the government. During the debate over gay marriage the slippery slope argument was often cited that if you legalize gay marriage next thing you know women will be wanting to marry a zebra or something. Personally I say if the Zebra can sign the documents and take the vows who am I to stand in the way of love? Frankly I dont see it as my business.The issue of plural marriage is more controversial its been associated with abuse forced marriage sexual assault of minors. But to my mind it would be more sensible to pass laws against abuse forced marriage and sexual assault than to ban plural marriage which does not inherently include any of this. My opinion is this I see no advantage and significant disadvantage to Government regulation of marriage. The marriage contract at its heart is just a civil contract that comes with tax incentives and a few other incentives such as inheritance rights and the ability to visit loved ones in the hospital. This contract should be governed by the people who want to enter into it and subject to no more or less restriction and oversight than other contracts. I invite you to change my viewFull disclosure I am currently in a polyamorous relationship with a partner I would very much like to marry some day but who also has another partner whom she would also like to marry someday. Obviously this would not currently be legal.',\n",
       "  'counters': 'The issue is that marriage as it stands is basically a default scheme predicated upon that legal status. As youve mentioned it deals from issues ranging from inheritance to taxes to medical decisions to child custody. These default rules can be modified via prenuptial agreements but it still stands as a basic package for people with a legally recognized relationship.Your suggestion flows from good intentions where couples who want to formalize their romantic relationship create their own contract and dictate its terms. The problem with this is that marriage touches on so many aspects over federal laws alone update that building it from the ground up is cumbersome time consuming and probably expensive to the extent it would require a lawyer. You would be asking people to contemplate all the circumstances and likelihoods that matrimonial law effectively does already by virtue of having the same issues arise for hundreds of years.In a way marriage functions as a very egalitarian institution because it is within easy reach of broad swaths of people. For . you can get what you or an attorney would for a fee have to draft. You would have to hope it contemplates all of the same things and that every clause is legally enforceable. Making it more costly actually legal fees and associated costs and through timeeffort spent makes marriage far less accessible. We already have an accesstojustice problem. Lowincome people cant get the legal representation they need particularly with civil issues because its too costly and pro bonolegal aid societies cant effectively pick up the slack.Requiring people to create marriagelike agreements piecemeal and then be on the alert to update it every time their circumstance changes is not only problematic generally but will just exacerbate this access issue and predominantly affect people in lower socioeconomic circles. Even when we talk about boilerplate forms one can download off the Internet these oftentimes fall short and would still require the creation and formalization probably notarized too of each and every right and responsibility flowing from marriage as it stands today.Also this ignores another issue nonmarital laws still work in conjunction with and refer to marital status. Social Security is not matrimonial law but it still creates benefits based on marital status. Inheritance law is not matrimonial law but it still creates rights and presumptions based on marital status. Evidence law is not matrimonial law but it still creates privileges based on marital status. Bearing this in mind. You cant just get the government out of marriage by turning it into a traditional contractual relationship because you would still have to get rid of statutorily created rightsbenefitsprivilegespresumptions that were drafted independently and. Since its unlikely that well just reform these laws piecemeal each individual law can still dictate what kind of relationships it chooses to acknowledges for the purpose of that statute i.e. still discriminate against peculiar kinds of relationships. We saw arise when some states legalized gay marriage but those couples only had equal status in state law not federal law preWindsor. You general you and your four partners can draft your contract but the SSA and Congress can still be jerks and say their death benefits are only for monogamous twoparty couples so long as they have a rational basis for it.Moreover the law that would govern traditional contracts is illsuited for the nature of marriage. Contract law is designed to facilitate armslength economic transactions to allow the economic pie to grow bigger. It is enforced in part by the state. Marriage is by definition intimate. We dont breach marriages. We dont sue our partners for damages if things dont work out. Instead we have equitable dissolution the parameters of which are outlined primarily by state marriage not contract laws. It was created to ensure both parties leave in the best way possible even if it is imperfect rather than making them pay. Sure we could keep these rules but then wed be circling right back to a special body of law that caters to the unique circumstances arising out of marriage that we just dont care about in a standard contracts.If were going to discuss marriage equality between monogamous and nonmonogamous couples it would probably be better to do things with an eye towards reform of present marriage law rather than nonmonogamous couples deferring to recreating a marriagelike scenario from the ground up. This is what gay and lesbian couples have historically had to do and there is a reason they pushed for marriage equality beyond the ability to make a solemn public declaration and thats because the extent to which that status affects the partners is massive.Marriage creates sensible rights defined contours and presumptions for important issues of natural consequence when we invest our lives finances and future into a community of interests. Getting government out of it is unlikely to solve its inequities.'},\n",

Will it hurt me at all?What about all those health nuts on allfruit diets or whatever? Shouldnt their blood be running thicker than molasses?It just seems like the most counterintuitive thing to me fruits which are high in sugar are also generally considered one of the healthiest things you can possibly be eating or feed to your children or whatever.So whats the deal? My instinct is that scare stories about natural fructose are total nonsense but I have zero science to back this view up in terms of how that sugar actually affects my body. So ?',\n",
       "  'counters': 'Sugar is sugar it does not matter upon which vessel it journeys into your body on sugar by any other mode of transportation would smell and taste as sweet. In a single mediumlarge apple there are g of sugar this is about . tbs. Now the assumption with diet is that people are going to eat something sweet every day. So when people say fruit is healthy they are really saying if you plan on eating something sweet go with fruit. A healthy diet is not one that deprives you of all the joy in the world it is one that makes use of every calorie you put in your body and fills it with as many nutrients and vitamins as possible. So what accompanies the sugars calories in an apple? A shit ton of vitamins fiber and various other nutrients that make the sugar content worth your while. Also they are relatively low in calories because of their near fat protein content. The fiber and nutrients allow an apple to satiate you on less than calories. Now go drink calories of fruit drinks and see if you feel satisfied. Chances are you wont. Fruit drinks are devoid of some of the nutrients and most importantly fiber that allows a calorie apple to satiate you. So if you need to feel full off of a sweet go with fruit over fruit drinks because the fruit will take you further. If you were to control for caloric intake and supplement fruit drink with fiber then it becomes comparable but this is just not how the average human drinks.Furthermore I believe a social aspect to this is apparent when we consider the reactionary nature of the media. For years fruit juicedrinks were considered healthy and parents were shoving this stuff down their kids throats because of this perception. However this turned out to be less than accurate and now their is a social backlash against the very thing once thought to be the perfect supplement to your little kids diet.And lastly the term healthy is relative. What is healthy for someone trying to lose weight is to be extremely conscious about every calorie they put in their body and eliminate as many unnecessary ones whereas a body builders healthy is taking in as much protein and fat. The term is used in a blanket fashion which is why we get people that are pounds underweight thinking they need to go on low carb diets because it is healthy. So fruit is healthy if you want something sweet and are moderating your eating since it is far easier to eat a moderate amount of sugar in fruit vs. the other alternatives which provide less nutritional value.'},\n",

Since disputes over who owns what will always arise some sort of adjudicator with the ability to force compliance is required. If someone wants your stuff there has to be some force to stop them. If there isnt your stuff is only your stuff until someone stronger trickier or luckier comes along and takes it from you. Protecting your stuff require resources. Taxation is the only plausible means for the financing of the state and thus the state taking money from you is necessary to your possession of anything at all. You might have a problem with your tax rate believing it to be too onerous but taxation at some level is necessary to ensure the ownership of property and thus taxation itself is ethical.

       "  'arguments': 'Often I hear the decision to not have a child described as selfish but I see it the other way around.When you become a parent your brain chemistry changes and you biochemically become a completely different person. Youve crossed the void and theres no going back your life is your childs and no longer your own.This is why parents can deal with babys crying and pooping and general nastiness because you are evolutionarily primed to love your child that much. Having a child is objectively a bad decision economically timewise etc. However the emotions that come with parenthood are indescribable for those without kids it truly is a drug. Not having child is objectively a great decision economically timewise etc. However you miss out on what a significant part of the human experience. Moreover it is much easier to fall into a life that feels purposeless without a child as an easy answer.When I weigh the two together I cant help but come to the conclusion that having a child getting high off of parenthood and creating conscious and needy life is more selfish than using the resources you would use on the child to better the world. I am making the assumption that instead of childbearing the wouldbe parent involves him or herself in some sort of meaningful charity work. I also want to be clear that Im not saying that having a child makes you a selfish person or even that having a child is necessarily selfish in and of itself. My view states only that it is more selfish than abstaining from parenthood.Full disclosure I am childless extremely young and completely unqualified to have a legitimate opinion on this topic.

       "  'counters': 'Well from one perspective both choices are equally selfish because they are just different answers to the question of What do I want from life? In both cases people have or dont have kids because thats what they want not because of broader societal consideration. Hence selfish.Im sure there are some people who do want kids but choose not to for ecological reasons. But theyre very much in the minority most of the people who talk about how selfless it is not to have kids are the people who actively dont want kids anyway and are thus making a virtue out of necessity. And most people who talk about how selfless parenthood is actually had kids because they wanted kids. Very few people dont want children but still choose to have them accidents of course are a separate issue.And its also pretty easy to argue that from a societal standponint parenting is the less selfish option. Theres a pretty persuasive paper about children being public goods that link is to the official TLDR as it were. Thats like a negative externality in reverse parents shoulder a disproportionate cost of raising kids the tax credits are a joke compared to the actual costs involved and thats just the monetary costs were not even talking about time and other less tangible resources while society reaps the benefit of a replacement generation.Now in a society with low infantmaternal mortality rates its good that so many people are opting to have no kids or like our family opting to have just the one. But again this is making virtue out of necessity when presented with reliable contraceptives many people choose not to have kids or to have fewer kids.But with both parents and nonparents the societal benefits are typically a sideeffect and not a major factor in the decisionmaking process. The choice is still made for selfish reasons.So its fine if you dont want kids really as long as youre not nasty to my kid for no reason I couldnt care less what you do with your life. But when youre old you will reap the benefits of having younger people to change your diaper and dispense your medication diagnose and treat your numerous ailments grow and transport your food stock your supermarkets keep your power on and put your fires out. If you dont think that todays kids who are tomorrows adults will be of benefit to you go read or watch Children of Men its not great literature or cinematography but it sure is thoughtprovoking. It is therefore unreasonable to claim that parents are more selfish than the childfree.

       "  'counters': 'Shortterm gains over longterm benefits is one of the most striking problems with democracy. Say you get elected in a democratic system and you have a term of four years before the next election. Your goal is to create benefits for your voters that will be seen before the next election so they will reelect you. Sometimes those shortterm benefits may produce longterm costs. Im talking immediate porkbarrel spending or tax cuts that will blow out the budget down the line. Or approving fracking on government land to create jobs in your electorate with little regard for longterm environmental impacts. That sort of thing. A system like a monarchy where rulers are in power for life might encourage longterm thinking.Popular vote causes more problems than shortterm vs longterm costs and benefits. Theres the lowest common denominator factor that often arises when you need to appeal to as many people as possible. Promising your voters goodies such as tax cuts new spending programs welfare benefits is a sure way to get elected. Its not only the politicians but more importantly the voters who think of the shortterm benefits of electing one candidate over the other. It would be incredibly difficult to win an election on the platform of reducing benefits for current voters so that years later the country will be in better shape.The need to win elections also leads to corruption. Funding is often required to help win elections. Some systems have attempted to reduce this problem through public campaign financing or restricting political donations. But its not as simple as that. Newspapers can play a large role in promoting a candidate. And if the owners of that newspaper also own shares in oil companies you might get their endorsement by promising more drilling contracts. Unions can also endorse certain candidates and encourage their members to vote a certain way. So restricting legal donations doesnt solve all corruption.Democracy is also not the best system depending on the current state of a country. If a country is in complete disarray a benevolent dictatorship might actually be better for a transitionary period. Democracies are slow. Acts of government need to be voted on by usually two houses of parliamentcongress and then signed into law by an executive. Thats a long process that begins with a politicians or several drafting a bill getting sponsors and cosponsors getting support for the bill putting it up for a vote negotiating amendments putting it up for another vote etc. Thats not ideal is a crisis situation. Which doesnt mean by the way that the country has to be in a complete state of chaos. A functioning democracy could be hit with a crisis e.g. an economicfinancial crisis in which case the democratic process becomes a hinderance. In the case of an economic crisis by the time a democratic governments gets around the recognising the problem drafting a response appeasing all sides voting on a response approving the response the crisis has either resolved itself or become worse in which case the governmental response is too little too late.After all that democracy may still seem the best system. Communism didnt work. Fascism was horrible. As far as twentiethcentury totalitarianism goes we definitely dont want that again. However there were better forms of dictatorship in the past. Enlightened Absolutism the Florentine Republic. It also doesnt have to be about democracy versus dictatorship. You could go the other way to some form of anarchist or nonstatist system of organising society. I may not have convinced you that democracy isnt the best system Im not convinced myself but I hope that you at least consider the possible that there is a better way maybe noone has theorised it yet of organising society than modern democracy. Democracy cant be as good as it gets.'},\n",

I know people who have committed suicide because of those things yet we dont consider them crimes. Why? Because relationships are deeply private affairs and it is no business of the state to dictate their terms.These laws will do very little to help victims of revenge porn. For a successful prosecution there has to be solid proof that it was the exlover who published the pictures and not some random hacker. But any disgruntled exlover who has a minimum of computer literacy knows how to publish pictures in an untraceable manner. Only the most stupid perpetrators will be caught.At the same time such laws are easy to abuse. I shudder at the inevitable cases of revenge revenge porn where lovers verbally consent to publish naked pictures and then change their mind once the relationship goes sour.Then there is also the problem that these laws are too vague. What is considered porn is in the eye of the beholder. I know women who would be extremely hurt if their exlover published a picture of them wearing lingerie. I know other women who would not even shrug their shoulders.Worst off all these laws will poison relationships because they promote paranoia towards the people who are closest to us.There are already libelslander laws to deal with this kind of behavior.

Its intended to threaten and intimidate. Uploading a random anonymous photo probably wont cause harm. Cheating and backstabbing cause only emotional harm. Financial exploitation has a vague definition but if actual fraud has been committed thats a more serious type of harm. Revenge porn with identifying information though could easily lead to lifethreatening harm. Laws already exist to protect against this kind of stuff and against similar activities like doxing but the laws are scattered across many civil and criminal codes which makes them unclear. As for poisoning relationships... I think the fact that people these days have to worry about their photos names addresses and occupations being posted to websites for the express purpose of encouraging vigilante harassment is a lot more damaging than a difficulttoenforce law!'},\n",

       "  'counters': 'If you dont have the discipline to touch bread then you probably wont have the discipline to stick to caloric restriction either. Very few people do. Its harder than it sounds. By imposing artificial limits on what kinds of stuff you can eat fad diets like atkins and paleo automatically reduce your caloric intake by making it harder to snack casually. You have to think about what youre eating to make sure it passes the diets rules and if you consciously think about every single meal youll probably eat less. The actual rules dont really matter though you could make snacking harder by sticking to a diet in which you only eat foods that start with letters AH. Counting calories and weighing everything you eat also requires that you think before you eat but the burden is much higher than sticking to a few simple rules. Overly burdensome rules lead to what psychologists call decision fatigue. If youre forced to make too many conscious choices in a day this includes both food choices and all other choices your decisionmaking capacity aka your willpower starts to decline. The best diet and exercise routine is the one that youre able to stick to long enough for it to become a permanent part of your lifestyle. The people who succeed by counting calories often have to keep counting calories forever or its likely that theyll gain the weight back. Most people are going to get bored or annoyed by the difficulty of estimating the caloric content of everything they eat. I think the most successful food restrictions are ones that people adopt as part of their personal identity. The bigger the dietary change the more it has to be internalized in order to succeed. Saying Im a vegan is a lot more psychologically powerful than saying I observe an arbitrary dietary guideline that prohibits all animalderived ingredients. Saying I belong to Weight Watchers is more psychologically powerful than saying I assign a certain point value to every food and attempt to stay within a certain daily point range. So do whatever diet you like as long as you seriously think youre going to be able to stick with it for at least several years.'},\n",

He had many facets to himself which society holds as ideal so its natural that the society will want to give him special celebration.Given that any emotion has a chemical cost of dopamine serotionin or whatever it makes sense for humans to reserve it for when its most desirable. If we empathized with everything we would deplete those chemicals and become numb. We would stop reacting to everything.As a result a society has to be selective in order to retain its empathy and then be able to act upon it.Toxic results such as negative local and international policy will have their results come more from the policymakers own lack of scruples. Case in point Parliament isnt creating new law proposals for things like preventative arrest theyre expediting existing ones. The downsides in policy which are visibly coming down the pipe now were simply coming down in the shadows before.If we were to force media blackouts to prevent selective empathy the same problems would occur.

The Nordic Model may have served to develop and distribute this wealth in a desirably way but hasnt necessarily created the wealth in the first place.I dont particularly agree with all these criticisms but theyre worth considering.One relevant question though Do you think the Nordic Model is the best possible system or just the best we have at the moment? I think any Swede Dane and Norwegian would say that they can point to flaws in our individual systems. Someone is always going to be at least a little bit dissatisfied but allowing yourself to think that this is the best we can do is harmful because our societies do have real problems as well even if theyre slightly smaller problems than some other nations face.One specific problem that Im familiar with because Im Danish is the fact that Danish societal coherence is largely based on ethnic and cultural homogeneity. This means that even if Denmark is doing great in the globalised economy it is facing a massive cultural struggle because there is no concept of Danish national identity that doesnt prescribe a very specific ethnic and cultural background. In a globalised world of many ethnicities this becomes a real problem that manifests itself both in very high levels of xenophobia but also in perpetual cultural insecurity which makes it difficult to interact with people from other backgrounds. This is how the idiom of the duck pond andedam in Danish has emerged as a metaphor not just for the country itself but for the slightly selfobsessed and selfimportant mentality of the Danes.Compare this with American national identity which is to a large degree grounded in the Constitution of the United States of America its rights freedoms and institutions rather than any specific ethnicity or culture although obviously a distinct American culture has emerged over the last century. This isnt to downplay racial issues in America but the point is that Danish minority identities arent even hyphenated. Its The Danes and The Muslims not The Danish Muslims.'},\n",

       "  'counters': 'I like a number of aspects of the Nordic model but there are a few things you are not consideringReduced poverty does indeed benefit everyone but when poverty rates are calculated the same way between advanced economies they are largely indistinguishable from one another there is a fairly good analysis including some history hereLargely where the US differs from other advanced economies is that our programs tend to be nonuniversal other then for old age transfers which is the reverse of the rest of the world as it is universal where it generally isnt elsewhere programs like public health are means tested where they are not elsewhere.The US actually has an identical tertiary enrollment rate to all the Nordic countries.A fairly persistent problem in the US its existed since the s and to a lesser extent elsewhere is that even with a rise in education skills acquisition has been relatively flat while people are entering and graduating from tertiary education at increased rates their marketable skills are not increasing. The problem here is caused by insufficient information being available to those embarking on tertiary education they dont understand what the future value of their skills will be so make poor choices regarding which skills to acquire.They are efficient due to their size states of the same size are similarly efficient.You would have a hard time justifying the US doesnt also do so but just in different ways. Public science amp healthcare RampD spending in the US is extraordinarily high compared to every other advanced economy EG The vast majority nearly of worldwide public vaccine research spending is in the US NiH and NSF actually fund research in the Nordic countries too.Which often fail. One of the reasons why Sweden went in a different direction in the s is due to their persistently high structural unemployment having double digit unemployment even in a boom is a significant problem and poses a very significant mobility issue. In many of the countries today they are finding similar problems in education people are becoming perpetual students obtaining degrees because they can rather then there is actually any value to them doing so.Growth in Nordic countries is certainly below potential but more significant globalization creates a great deal of interaction between countries economies such that high growth countries with significant trade will necessarily increase growth in other countries. There is a good paper on the Nordic vs US models from this perspective hereBeyond the moral case its hard to make a case for inequality being bad its simply not causal with any negative economic outcomes. Poverty amp mobility are the issues which actually do impact outcomes but always seem to take a back seat.Check out Northern New England. US national figures are biased by a couple of places DC particularly which have very high crime rates.Different healthcare then the US better accessibility but lower quality of care it largely depends on how you consider healthcare issues.Beyond political reports we really dont rank healthcare systems of advanced economies they all have good quality of care and all respond to local lifestyle amp political factors. The US is expensive but offers a wider array of treatment options then other countries there are simply too many points of bias for any ranking to be useful so they are largely considered to be equivalent.Agreed we spend the nd highest per child in the world and perform shockingly badly. K is in desperate need of reform.This is does do nearly half of total world capital is available in the US. Net capital flows in advanced economies is towards to the US rather then away from it. As a good example even the European pharmas perform the majority of their RampD in the US EG Most of GSKs RampD is in MA. Capital created in the Nordic countries will typically end up in the UK or US.As a quibble there is no such thing all nonartificial growth is good for everyone. If we had a magic wand which would add to growth immediate we should wave it higher wages reduced prices relative to incomes etc.A better intermediate model which largely accomplishes what you are likely looking for would be the German system. Their healthcare system is incredible the works council system is incredible but currently illegal in the US and while I dont think we need to legislate it in the same way the shared prosperity principles are really interesting.'},\n",

Canada looks a lot like the Scandinavian countries on measures of happiness education life expectancy economic mobility and GDP per capita and is relatively close on income inequality Its also an aggressively multicultural nation of immigrants which specifically rejects the need for homogeneity Because of this the Canadian economic educational and legal systems arent built on shared identity and trust but rather on a sort of consequentialist pragmatism. Canada tends in general terms over a multidecadal time scale to adopt policies that work and discard ones that dont. In this it contrasts sharply not only with its idealistic southern neighbours but also with the differentlyidealistic political culture of Scandinavia.So I think you should consider Canadas model as a more generallyapplicable candidate.'},\n",

       "  'counters': 'I do believe there is a series of points that may counter this First I dont believe your polling should be taken at face value as representing the average atheist. Even if the average atheist wasnt willing to change their views in light of certain arguments or evidence doesnt mean that their position is not falsifiable. Your point I believe when put more succinctly is that if atheists were logically consistent then their skepticism would not allow anything to ever be evidence of God any more so than x matrix style theory. You seem to admit evidence of God would otherwise falsify an atheistic position if it were not for the equally as likely competing matrix theory.Lets for now assume all matrix style theories were proven false somehow leaving the question entirely of whether or not a God is responsible for our reality. If God was proven to exist through some hypothetical method it would obviously prove strong atheists wrong because they say there is no God. For Soft atheists they do not say there is no God but that it is unreasonable to conclude that there is a God. Obviously again proving God exists proves them wrong. In both cases if it was entirely about God proving himself regardless of alternative theories atheism would be falsifiable if it could be established that there is reason to believe in God. This is important because it helps establish the only thing blocking according to your thesis atheism from being falsifiable and thats the fact that no evidence no matter how logical or blatant could disprove the possibility that everything is a false reality. So in order to show that atheism is falsifiable we must prove that reality is real... or merely that its unreasonable to think otherwise. I would wager without official resources or citations at my disposal that the average atheist actually would find the idea of God existing more reasonable than the matrix theory. We use many justifications for why our perceived reality can be reasonably taken at fact value. Basically we assign more logical stock in reality than we do the idea that its false. This can be demonstrated in our behavior. We behave in such a way that we are betting on reality being real and relevant. We never hold the matrix theory as being on equal terms as math science or our perceptions. As such it would be dishonest if God was demonstrated via math science or our perception to all of a sudden assign equal value to the matrix theory. If God was proven by logic our perception science or math then if we are being consistent we would not choose the matrix theory over the God proof thus making atheism in all its forms falsifiable. However this is only if we go off of how the average atheist thinks and I believe I safely assume the average atheist bets on reality being real each day. I earlier pointed out that a position being falsifiable is not reliant on how the group would react if honest but instead is based on what the logically consistent course is. By that I mean what if we are wrong to value perceived reality as being on a greater level than the matrix theory? Many would say that would be wrong indeed making my entire point refuted at this point. I only pointed out that atheists all people actually behave as if this debate between reality and the matrix has long been settled. That doesnt mean it actually is. If atheists cannot logically show why reality is more logical to conclude than any matrix theory then it would indeed appear that no matter how convincing God is in this reality it could all just as easily be dismissed as illusion. What we have demonstrated in this is that there is an inconsistent use of your word falsifiable. If atheism cannot be falsified because of the matrix then in this same method nothing ever could be falsified. It appears even for this question to be asked we much assume several things. First we must assume logic is the best determination for truth. For anything to be false or true there must be some agreed method to determine such qualities. I assume logic and all it entails is the method we are using. As such anything that can be logically concluded as true is to be considered true. If the matrix was true then nothing else could be at least in the way we mean it. At this point we accept logic and all of its conclusions. So if we accept that your question means anything then we acknowledge logic as being a valid determination of truth quality. Therefore because logic can determine what is true or false then a God proven true or false via a logically valid and sound method would falsify atheism. Further complicating matters is if you say that God cannot be proven true via logic either because he does not exist or because his nature prevents such a thing. In this case atheism is only not falsifiable because it is true in one sense or another. If God does not exist then both atheism strong and soft are true. If God eludes the ability to be concluded logically then the soft atheist is right in claiming God cannot be logically concluded. Only then is not being falsifiable a flaw if all correct claims are not flawed because they two are not falsifiable. No true claim can actually be falsifiable without creating a contradiction. TLDR In conclusion if anything can be falsified then the matrix theory is irrelevant otherwise it would prevent every position ever taken to be not falsifiable. For the same reason a scientific theory can be falsified without invoking the matrix so can the atheists claim. If you do hold that the matrix theory prevents atheism from being falsifiable and therefore every other position possible then it being not falsifiable is irrelevant. Finally if logic is a sufficient determination of truth then atheism can only be not falsifiable in a sense if its true meaning its impossible to falsify that which is true. It does not though follow that all things not falsifiable are true. Verdict Only an intellectually dishonest atheist would use the matrix theory to escape what would otherwise be proof of God.'},\n",

       "  'arguments': 'I think its ultimately harmful to purposefully deny truth to children or at least it is more valuable than the intentions behind lying.Take the misinformation of Calvins dad for example Why would you ever want to lead your children astray like this? Because they cant handle the truth until theyre older? Why not just tell them the truth in the first place? What are you protecting them from? Why not answer every question with scientific accuracy instead of lying to them? Are you not their teacher? Why lead them down a road of ignorance?All of these lies in this list can be circumvented in a constructive way and it is the responsibility of the parent to find that with truth.Regarding the Santa lie Ive heard people say that the day they discovered the truth about Santa was the day their childhood ended. I dont think prolonging the magic of Santa and belief is what makes children children. I think its the curiosity and playfulness that defines them. The only way to healthily encourage that is with truth.Denying the inevitable truth about death and sex will do more damage than not. Perhaps this is the reason so many people are scared of it. Perhaps they wouldnt be if they learned to come to terms with the world around them while theyre still plastic.Please note I do not have children and understand that I am missing a huge perspective required here. I have come to to try to take in some of that perspective. Thank you. I came here for a parental perspective and you put me in the tough and subtle situations in which the best course of action is to repair the bubble. Thanks again for the great conversation I look forward to putting it all into practice years or so from now dont worry!MVCd',\n",

I wouldnt call this an intimate experience but rather just me and my friend enjoying each others company. On the other hand I could take a girl out on a date at a nice restaurant and share an intimate moment with her.

For example forget sex for a second have you ever made out with someone casually? Or danced with them? Or gone to dinner? What all of these things have in common is that if you do them with someone youre in love with and care deeply about the act takes on a greater meaning and value because youre doing it with that person and that means something to you.The fact that you can have those events be an intimate experience does not mean however that thats all they can be. Ive gone to dinner with anything from acquaintances to friends to people I was in a relationship with and its different based on who its with. Ive danced with complete strangers in clubs and concerts but that doesnt undermine what it means to dance with someone I care about.Sex is the same. You can do it casually with whoever and have it be a casual whatever thing or you can do it with someone youre in love with and have it be a deep emotional thing.

       "  'counters': 'Must make a challenge to something in OPs original post... Okay heres my two centsIf casual sex is not your thing I dont see why you should psych yourself into it. First of all theres a chance youll change your mind again right after the deed is done and now youve dragged someone into your troubles. Theres also the inherent risks of a partner who could turn against your consent or simple accidents like broken condoms. My vote would be this. Someone you know and trust cuts down on some of these risks and youre more likely to receive understanding if you freak out after he sex. Alternatively you may actually really like it and now you have a partner for it.So Id like to nix your casual stranger sex option off the table and instead look for a nice solid loverFWB.Now the real reason for commenting Id like to commend you for posting here on looking to actually change your view.

Virtually everyone is more pragmatic than that. Im a useless liberal who believes in social wellfare because current society is capable of delivering it. I believe some guns should be restricted because they present a greater danger to the general public than they prevent. Im anti death penalty because it doesnt deter crime and costs more money than life inprisonment. If society as we know it collapses my stances on these issues might change.Also consider that veggies and environmentalists care about how our current society affects the environment. If soceity collapses these problems might not exist anymore. Many vegetarians are antifactory farming but have no qualms with hunting or fishing. Same thing with environmentalists.

       "  'counters': 'Yes youre right. Taken at facevalue as you presented them these liberal opinions would likely be a detriment to someone in a postapocalypitcal scenerio. However I think you are wrong in one or two of four ways for each of your ten liberal ideals.Here are the four ways in which I think youre wrong these dont all apply to all of your liberal ideals. You misunderstand the rationale behind this liberal ideal. If you properly stated the rationale you could show that the same rationale could lead to different behavior in a postapolocalyptic scenerio.In other words liberals could behave differently in a postapocalypitic scenerio than they do now without going against their ideals.. This liberal ideal isnt a liberal ideal.. This liberal ideal would actually be advantageous.. This liberal ideal is neither advantageous nor disadvantageous.Heres how I think youre wrong for each of your liberal ideals Gun control advocates Way Gun control advocates arent I hate guns because theyre guns. Most gun control advocates argue against guns because it is safest to leave them in the hands of the qualified as in those who are more likely to make the best decisions as to when a gun should and shouldnt be pulled and fired. In other words the police or military. The police or military wouldnt exist if society collapses so most gun control advocates could rationally pick up guns until we could reestablish a police force while still being able to say that only certain people should have guns once were safe again.. Anti huntersVegansVegetarians Way Not all Vegans and Vegetarians dont eat meat because they find it disgusting or immoral. Many Vegans and Vegetarians dont eat meat because of health environmental and cost concerns. Sure there are some that dont eat meat because the act of killing animals disgusts them so these would have to come to terms with hunting and eating meat which they would likely be able to if confronted with starvation. However Vegans and Vegetarians with health concerns could eat meat because you have to eat something to stay healthy they could stop eating meat when addtional food sources were avaiable. Vegans and Vegetarians with environmental concerns wouldnt have to worry because there would be way fewer humans therefore they could eat meat without worrying that the meat industry was damaging the environment. And Vegans and Vegetarians with concerns over the cost of meat wouldnt have to worry because meat would be free. SocialistsWealth redistributers Way I think it can be argued that sharing resources and not worrying about private property for some time would likely be the best way to reestablish society at which time a more capitalist society could be established. Its difficult to tell for sure but most humans seem to lean toward sort of a socialist group structure when in a dangerious situation because that is most effective and most consistent with our tribal nature. Pacifists Way Pacifists feel that violence should be avoided at all costs and that nonviolent solutions should be sought. That doesnt mean that they believe they shouldnt ever be violent. They could be violent if it meant their survival while still maintaining pacifist ideals. CopSoldier haters Way I dont think this is a liberal ideal. At least not any more than Fred Phelps ideals were Conservative Ideals. Feminists Way So nonFeminist women wouldnt get raped? Only the Feminist ones? How would the Feminist ones be at a disadvantage? Race baiters Way People dont just shoot other people because they have differing opinions even in a postapocalyptic scenerio. If you were to shoot someone because they spoke out slightly about how their race was oppressed youd likely be ostrasized by your group and likely killed too. Also I really doubt a race baiter would speak out against anyone of another race if they were accepting of each other in a peaceful group of survivors. Intellectual snobsLogic mongers Way and Way Again I dont really consider this a liberal ideal. People who are snobby and elitist can be liberal or conservative. And I really doubt that anyone is snobby enough that someone else could rationalize shooting them in the face wed still have morals and wed still feel remorse for the snobby person even if society went to shit. AntiDeath Penalty Advocates Way This one is tricky. Ill give you that. However I can try Many antideath penalty advocates advocate against it because there are other alternatives to the death penalty in our modern effective society such as rehabilitation. I think most antideath penalty advocates would acknowledge that rehabilitation would be impossible if society collapsed. Therefore they could still rationalize killing someone if there was no alternative unlike in modern society where there are alternatives. Environmentalists Way This is probably the liberal ideal that you leastaccurately represented. Environmentalists are worried about humans destorying the Earth on a widespread scale not about cutting down enough trees for a small group of survivors to survive. The Earth can easily recover from the latter equivalently the latter is sustainable. Environmentalists are concerned about unsustainable practices such as in those that cause permanent damage to the Earth. They wouldnt care about a small group of survivors cutting down trees or eating certain animals to survive.'},\n",

I know that not ALL of any of the types of people listed wouldnt survive in some way. Thats why I used primarily in the title. I also know that some of these types will survive if they were to give up or go against their ideals. Pick up a gun etc. The overall point of the is that those who cling to those leftist ideals wont generally survive long term. So I will not argue with you over semantics or word usage. liberal leftist useless etc I think youre smart enough to argue the spirit of the without resorting to that cliche.I want someone to show me exactly how somebody who insists on clinging to these ideals would survive and be useful to the other survivors.P.S.

And because meat spoils much more rapidly than canned plant foods root vegetables etc. it will probably become important for everyone to subsist on a majorityvegetarian diet after initial meat stores deplete.Once a few months pass raising animals for food becomes pretty unreasonable from a resourceutilization perspective. The calorie conversion ratios from vegetable protein to animal protein are absurdly low ranging from to depending on the food source and the animal. Therefore except in limited circumstances raising animals for food is out the land should strictly be used to cultivate highcalorie starch vegetables like beans potatoes corn etc..Now Im going to flip it around on you for a second.

       "  'counters': 'As a one time vegetarian even a vegan for a few years when I was younger for me the morality or immorality of eating meat was conditional. My reasoning was basically that animals feel pain and seem to feel emotions like fear different animals to different extents. If there is no need for me to cause pain to an animal capable of experiencing it in order for me to meet my nutritional requirements then it is immoral for me to do so. I can in fact get all the nutrition required for healthy living without consuming products that cause animals to suffer so I feel it is most moral for me to do so.In fact I still feel that what I wrote above holds even though I eat meat now were all flawed I guess. My first girlfriend was horribly allergic to soy and lots of other things including chocolate. She would be hard pressed to get enough protein in her diet without meat due to her dietary restrictions. I never considered it immoral for her to eat meat even though I felt it was immoral for me to do so. If I were to try to enforce my beliefs about moral dieting on others something I wouldnt do btw it would have to be very conditional. I might say that I think it would be best and most moral if humans who live in areas where plant based nutrients can efficiently provide for sufficient nutrition for people to be healthy to avoid consuming animal products and to stop maintaining a massive factory farming system for the production of animals for slaughter. I think this would be good for the environment good for human health and ethical with regards to how humans treat animals.This wouldnt be practical for many regions and many cultures at the moment and so it wouldnt make sense to view them as immoral for their dietary choices and food producing practices. Even if I held to an absolute moral conviction that humans eating meat is wrong it still wouldnt make sense to apply that to animals. The predator prey relationships that make up life for wild animals is key to the balance of lots of different biological and natural systems. Forcibly removing all predation from the wild would cause massive harm to even cute cuddly herbivores everywhere within a few animal generations so it wouldnt necessarily be moral. Also killing all the predators would be its own moral conundrum.tldr summation would be that the morality of consuming meat needs to be conditional and qualified to really make any sense at all and that being the case it just doesnt make sense to apply it to animals or even all people everywhere. Even if you assume it to be an absolute moral principle that eating meat is always and everywhere wrong acting on that principle would be absurd and create absurd outcomes.'},\n",

We provide them with safety food and shelter. In return the animals provide us with a portion of their life span. There is a form of symbiosis here where domesticated food animals receive the benefits of human technology but at the cost of shortened lives.This is a bit dicey intellectually because what Im describing is essentially an economic contract and animals are not capable of entering into such contracts of their own volition. If you could ask a cow whether it would be willing to trade a potentially long life in the wild where it may have trouble finding food mates and shelter and faces many threats from predators for a shorter life where its safety shelter and food supply are guaranteed what would it choose? Personally I think the cow would pick the second option but since its incapable of understanding and choosing which scenario it prefers I dont see a problem with humans making that decision.Now this assumes that we actually fulfill our end of the deal. We should be providing food animals with safe happy habitats until the time comes for us to kill them for their meat.

And in this case tackling the problem at the roots would carry with it a multitude of other problems.Womens RightsIn countries where women have more equal rights birth rates have a tendency to be lower.This is because in countries where women have something nearer to equal rights they want to be doctors lawyers social workers computer programmers business women engineers journalists. They tend to have fewer kids and to have them later because there are other areas in which they can find fulfillment.If on the other hand you make raising children the one fulfilling activity for an entire half of your population theyre going to have more children. Not because theyre wired to want children or any sexist nonsense like that but just simply because its all their society will let them do.Accessible Sex EducationA lot of pregnancies happen because people dont have access or reliable and up to date sex education.They dont realize that free condoms are available on their college campuses or at local health centers they dont realize that there are places and programs that can get them free or cheap birth control pills. Teenagers are taught abstinence education rather that how to protect themselves.Not only will this help to prevent unplanned pregnancies which as a year old seem to be the most common kind among my peer group and younger it will help to prevent the spread of STDs.Less Social and Economic InequalityLower income families are likely to have more children than those who live on a more wealthy income bracket.This partially lends itself to fewer opportunities for women and lack of access to resources and education. But statistically helping those people out of situations where they dont receive much money and providing them with more opportunity will also result in a lower birth rate. It will also help to create a better and more free society.In conclusion not only does it carry the exploitative factors mentioned by the other posters but its implementation would be illogical because of the expenses required and the fact that it addresses only the symptoms of other problems that persist in our world.A much better solution would be to tackle the problems that cause a high birth rate and population hitting a dozen birds with only a couple proverbial stones.'},\n",

In my opinion government regulation of this industry constitutes a violation of personal liberty undermines the economic growth of the prospective destination countries and inflates the price of domestic healthcare by forcibly eliminating foreign competition.Examples of regulation include limiting travel to government approved zones countries etc limiting the kinds of treatment allowed e.g. banning certain procedures deemed to dangerous or perhaps banning travel for procedures which are illegal in the country like abortions or euthanasia making the buying of insurance to cover the procedure compulsory and so on. It could also be controlled by the receiving countries in a third world country a government may not want scarce medical worker resources going toward rich white people.',\n",
       "  'counters': 'I think you should look at this from the position of a government. Your domestic healthcare policy decisions have been made for reasons that the government considers good ones. For example the government has set training standards hygiene standards and ethical standards for medical procedures.There is for example a reason we do not allow a seven year old girl to get breast implants.Now those policy decisions have consequences in the real world. The price of an operation is higher the range of surgeries available to the public is narrowed and there might even be a wait for a specific procedure. This results in a demand that is not being met.Foreign countries can fill this demand the question is should they. I think that in some instances yes they ethically can and the government of the home country should not interfere. In Canada or the UK for example there are often long waits for surgeries due to public financing of the health care systems. If patients wish to go abroad for treatment to the USA specifically it is win win. The patient gets treated early someone else moves up a spot in line back home and the domestic system saves money.However if someone wants to have their six year old daughter given breast implants and finds an indian doctor willing to do it I think the government very much has a role to step in and say no. I think this is what should change your view that there are certain extreme cases where very clearly the government of a country has made the correct moral decision about a procedure and can and should impliment laws to stop people from getting it abroad. Another example would be the MS liberation treatment that was a scam. Researchers in the field thought it was dodgy and ran studies to confirm but in the meantime huge numbers of people wanted a dangerous and useless procedure.The middle case not being able to afford care but finding it cheaper in india is a harder example and I leave that up to each persons own moral judgments. However I think the above should change your view.'},\n",

       "  'arguments': 'As a person of above average height I often find I have trouble in many airliner configurations with the amount of space available. Many times my legs end up pressed right up against the seat in front of me. This is uncomfortable for me as it often hurts forces me to arrange my legs in strange ways to actually be able to sit comfortably and often even prevents me from lowering the tray table fully. It is also uncomfortable for other people as the person in front of me usually cannot recline their seat and has to deal with my knees in their back and the persons next to me often have to put up with my feet in their footwell as they cannot fit anywhere else. It can also be dangerous if I am wedged in a seat as I often am I am less able to move freely in case of evacuation and could also block other people in my row.My height is not a disability nor an abnormality. I am able to lead a completely normal life and have no difficulties or hindrances in almost any other walk of life. It is also something I have absolutely no control over and something that cannot be changed. As such it is my view that where available on airliners I should be able to access seats with extra legroom at no extra cost.In many airlines it is the case that one can purchase seats with extra legroom and no other change or increase in service. In these cases I think tall people should be offered these seats without having to pay the extra charge. Of course tall people can waive their right to these seats if they want to make sure they sit next to their travelling companions but the offer should be made. I dont mind how airlines decide how to implement this whether by visual inspection when you check in requiring you to be measured I wouldnt mind having my height measured to be able to fly in minimum comfort when allocating seats or any other method. However I think that the desires of those who pay for extra leg room should not outweigh the need of tall people to fit in their seat and that as long as someone is over a certain height which the airline could determine based on their knowledge of their seating arrangements they should be offered a chance to sit somewhere with enough space for them without any extra cost.At the very least I think emergency and even bulkhead row seats should not be sold at an extra premium and should be reserved for tall people. If there are no tall by the airlines definition passengers then they could be allocated to anyone who is lucky enough. If an airline wishes to make profit of extra leg room seats they should install seats with extra leg room and should no be allowed to make their profit at the expense of people who literally cannot help how tall they are. !',\n",

Apparently the latter half is just support or something?It seems like on your definition entire fields constituted of people who call themselves scientists are not really science.Lets suppose I spend years working hard in the lab on a new project to characterise important factors for the motility of a parasite in order to generate possible targets for drug discovery. Ill describe the kind of thing that might involve. So suppose I knocked out a panel of genes in my parasite and saw that one of the geneknockout strains had abnormalablated motility when looked at in the microscope. Then I break open some normal parasite cells and isolate the protein after which I check to see if anything else comes out along with it any other proteins binding to it for instance. I see from this that it does interact with some other proteins so I find out the amino acid sequence of each one. Using the amino acid sequences I search a database of the parasites genome to see where the corresponding genes are I find them there and I use that knowledge to isolate the DNA of each gene from the parasite. Several of these genes were previously unknown. Not only that but lets imagine I realise one of the genes is a well studied protein already known to have important roles in parasite motility as a scientist my pulse would be racing at this point. So anyway I put each gene including the original gene I knocked out inside a strain of E.coli so that I can make large amounts of protein for each on demand. I do that then purify the proteins again in large quantities and I determine their crystal structures of each protein in a big interacting complex from which I learn just by looking that my gene that I knocked out seems to play an important role in maintaining the structure of the already famous protein. Elated I submit my work to the journal Science and my groundbreaking investigation is lauded as one of the most important within the field for years. But you know what? I discovered several new genes one of which is important to the parasites motility and therefore infectivity and discovered a key missing link in understanding the function of an already very well studied protein... didnt do any science though according to you.Neither did Rosalind Franklin James Watson and Francis Crick do any science when they got the structure of DNA. Nor did the Human Genome Project when they found out so much about our own genetic make up. And actually the whole disciplines of genomics proteomics and transcriptomics? Not really science.

In the old days all you had to do was plunk down a Nielsen sheet in front of an advertiser showing points for an episode of the X Files and suddenly youve got a show that everyone wants a piece of. Today its become normal for people to pay alright prices for point and top dollar for usually stuff like football home games or premieres. And everyone is doing the same numbers. An episode of breaking bad one of the most critically lauded shows of all time might get a . whereas in a local market here an episode of Arrow might do the same just cause thats whats on. Since so many shows get the same numbers but some get more hype than others a salesperson has to convince advertisers why their show might fit the client better. This is why you see ads for haunted houses and upcoming horror movies when you turn on an episode of American Horror Story and ads for musicals and headphones when youre watching Glee.Sure you have your filler ads by the big companies that drop money just to be included in whatever program but salespeople at least at a local level have gotten a lot more creative recently with how they pitch shows to prospective advertisers. Ads are a lot more targeted to the demographics that view the shows the ads play on. For example IHOP only airs in early morning shows and has a am cutoff cause they want you to go out and get pancakes right away. Characters in ads now have cult followings like Mayhem Flo the old spice guy and the most interesting man in the world. So even though you still have to sit through a bunch of ads during commercial breaks the chances of one of those ads appealing to you are much higher because that sort of evolution was actually needed for advertisement to continue on TV. This brings me back to the original point.Rather than a valid mode of advertising collapsing after the advent of new shows taking up more and more market share or the invention of devices that let you fast forward through commercials TV advertising has grown and evolved.The same will happen with online advertising when adblock becomes enough of a disruption. It will be up to advertisers to find a way to make people want to turn it off.

Also a fallacious smiley face could be syntactically confusing if placed at the end of a sentence because it fuses with whatever punctuation that the sentence contains.

If looking at a mirror image of oneself and tilting their head to the right the smiley would naturally be oriented in the fashion. I know that some of you will invariably argue for the photographic version instead of the mirror image version but most people look at themselves in the mirror more often than in photos.On the keyboard itself it is much more natural to go from a higher key to a lower key rather than the other way around.

Hate speech is speech that attacks a person or group on the basis of attributes from Wikipedia. and the subreddit is basically that judges attacks a group in the basis of an attribute. i actually decided to be passive aggressive and wrote a summary about hate speech. and i got this comment Hate speech laws dont apply to hate speech against Bronies because legally speaking they arent considered people.

I really hate making other people feel especially for no reason. I try very hard to be a nice person which I guess is both my biggest strength and weakness. Ive often tried to be generous with buying things for people like steam games or just letting them keep any money they owe me etc but it seems like people often take advantage of that. One time I decided to give someone a game on steam since they got a new pc just as a friendly gesture but they never gave me anything back that wasnt the reason I gave them something I just feel like I would of done if I was them they just kept asking me If I had anymore games for them and then unfriended me when I didnt give them anyAlso when I was at school there was a very sweet boy with adhd people used to be really mean to him and do things like hide his clothes and spray deodorant in his face I just dont get it. how can people act like that?A few months ago a popular youtube games critic made a vlog saying that he had got cancer the point of the video was saying that he made a stupid mistake didnt get himself checked when he was having problems and didnt want other people to make the same mistake. I found tons of posts and comments often upvoted ones pretty much laughing at him and saying that it was karma because one got angry when someone was harassing him and his family online. He know people would act like this and he was most likely very embarrassed by it but he wanted to do something selfless he was worse of for making that video and the people laughing at him were enjoying laughing at him.The worst part to me is that it seems like the people who try to be nice often get screwed over and the opposite happens to the idiots.I try to convince myself its just the vocal minority but judging by how often I see people acting like this then I struggle to believe it especially with my point about the popular youtube channels.It may not sound like much and I probably sound pretty arrogant when I say it but I have to be honest and things build up a lot I guess.basically it seems like its the majority or atleast very close that seem to act like this now and not just the vocal minority. sorry about the poor wording in some of this Im not used to writing anything longer than a comment.',\n",
       "  'counters': 'I want to talk to you OP.I want to talk to you as a human being. I want to tell you a story about something that happened to me at work. I work a software support job I help people troubleshoot technical and usage issues with my companys software. Its at its core a customer service job and there are certainly downsides. But this isnt one of those stories. It is easy to just say Customers are assholes and be cynical and closed off and bitter about everything so I try not to do that.There was an issue that came in not too long ago that was urgent and very difficult it involved a part of our software that I specialize in so I grabbed the case and called the client. The client well call her Megan was very panicked and kind of angry. So I got to work troubleshooting. We made some progress and fixed the most urgent thing but then there was a more difficult issue that took me hours and a dozen database queries to pin down. During this time Megan had calmed down considerably and was engaging me in pleasant conversation while I worked and we chatted amicably about our lives. I learned that she lives in Canada and has a teenage daughter. I also learned that we share a sense of humor as we were both making each other laugh throughout this entire ordeal making stupid puns and generally just being goofy with each other. At the end of a late day a Friday no less wed finally nailed everything down and we were still chatting for another minutes after we couldve just gone about our Friday nights.She and I still keep in touch and are friendly. Now heres the twist ending This is not unusual for me doing my job. I have plenty of clients who know me by name who ask me how my day is going even when Im not working with them and who as far as I can tell to some degree enjoy my company and I enjoy theirs.Now Im not some supersocial creature who goes around mingling Im extremely shy outside of work and the internet. The key I think is that I associate the voice on the other end of the phone with another human being who probably laughs at corny jokes has their own set of life experience who has likely loved and lost who has their own set of priorities and needs and stressors that all affect their interactions with the world. The difference is and I think this is important I hear their voice and they hear mine. We can communicate through intonation and I can hear the inflections in their voice and understand the messages that arent spoken in words. This amplifies in person when you can see body language.Now this is I think the answer to using the internet as a source when you are separated from the other person by a witty user avatar a wall of emotionless text and careful editing there isnt as much human to respond to. Words on a page arent a person talking theyre information nothing more. You cant hear the tone of my voice or see my face so why should you care about me as a person? That is what the internet does for us it is way way easier to be a dick on the internet.As for the other part yes the real world isnt immune to assholes. Some people are just selfish and thats a sad fact. But the world is also full of good things and good people the problem with getting your information about the world at large is that the news is far from unbiased they decide what stories to run and the way they decide that is based on how many butts theyll put in seatshow many issues theyll sell. The fact is that they dont report on people being decent human beings because that isnt interesting. Moreover they dont report on people being decent human beings because that isnt news. Now you might think that thats a bad thing but I think that it is great that being kind isnt so rare as to be newsworthy! If you need more convincing take a look here its essentially a repository for fuzzy feelgood things many of them news stories and those are just the most exceptional examples that managed modest coverage on some obscure or local sources.As cheesy as it is I firmly believe that the internet will show you what you want to see. If you go looking for the good in humanity you will find it. But if you go looking for the bad you will find it as well.'},\n",

You know this youve basically said so yourself in your OP.Now Im almost positive that the girl trying to dress up as the Walking Dead character wasnt trying to be racist I dont think shes American either and racism is sort of contextual people outside of America wont view blackface the same way as Americans do. And it does seem unfair to tell her that by putting makeup on to look like a black character is racist. So yes what happened to that girl was sort of uncalled for in the sense that maybe she didnt know that blackface was racist in America. Maybe people shouldnt have called her racist. Maybe.But the thing is... she doesnt have to change her skin color to dress up as a character. I mean there are black people who cosplay as Naruto who dont cover themselves in whiteAsian colored makeup and its not even considered racist to do that. The costume alone plus the hairwig? should suffice as it has for many many other people. Its not that you arent allowed to dress up as someone of your own ethnicity you can dress up as literally anyone you want. Its that there are some things that... generally speaking were done en masse to an entire race of people that was degrading and intentional. And one of those things was blackface. People today are still racist. But racism hasnt made such substantial leaps and bounds that we can just be okay with providing racists with a new way to degrade an entire race of people. If we start cherry picking Its okay if youre doing it to look like XY person because of YZ reason or Its okay as long as youre celebrating XY race then you put power into hands of people who probably will abuse that power. Either you can punish everyone for blackface or start evaluating every single case of blackface that pops up on its own merits. And Im not saying that evaluating every case of blackface is wrong but dont you think there are other things we should be doing instead of focusing on blackface? Im not trivializing it Im just saying that blackface is not going to get us that much closer to true equality which is the ideal that youve brought up. Solving blackface isnt going to be a huge step towards an equal world itll be a relatively small one in the face of actual things that would lead us towards true equality that affects the entire world like world hunger. I dont even think we can ever be truly equal... so theres that. So my question is why focus on blackface as the thing leading us to true equality? If blackface is seen as racist to a large group of people because it was used for years to degrade them over something they couldnt control which it is and if equality means that all people are treated equally... then we would reach true equality by respecting their discomfort with something that has been used to hurt them for a long period of time just as they would respect anyone elses discomfort with something that has been used to hurt another group for a long time. Youre trying to reach true equality do you think that its okay to say to that group of people Just because you think its racist doesnt mean it is its okay as long as XXYY is happening? Even if you didnt mean to hurt someone by coloring your face to look like them wouldnt a group of people who understand that their race has been marginalized and stigmatized by society be sort of upset when someone who benefited from their marginalization used the very thing that marginalized them as a costume?Maybe when other problems are figured out as a consequence blackface wont be seen as racist anymore.'},\n",

I am currently in high school marching band and have never been good at any actual sports.A sport has always been a competitive activity that involves either individuals or teams competing against each other to win a game or match. Sports have clear winners that can be determined by either the amount of points an individual or team wins ex football soccer tennis etc. or which individual or team finishes first ex swim track etc..Therefore anything that cannot be determined to have a clear winner should not be considered a sport. Even if you dont accept this definition there is a clear difference between artistic activities and athletic activities. Athletic events require mostly physical fitness and coordination and have a clear winner. Artistic events like marching band and dance may require physical activity but mostly utilize ones creative interpretation. Additionally artistic events cannot be judged objectively and artistic competitions almost always have judges who use their own subjection to determine the winners.Now for some reason there has been a strange push in the last decade or so to define just about any and all extracurricular activities as sports especially in high schools. When meeting someone in high school instead of asking what that person enjoys to do the primary question seems to be what sports do you play.

I dont have a formulated argument for this because I think this is selfevident due to the fact that every SCT advocate has an affirmative worldview and think that society should be run in adherence with it. Change my view.. God created man. This doesnt have the be God of the Bible or even the God of a theistic religion. To my knowledge most western religions hold this to be true.. Because God is totally free so are humans. I want to qualify this. No one is free to harm another person. If people were free to harm other people then no one would be free. . Since these rights were given to people by God people can not take these rights away. People can surrender various rights as that is a right.Thats my approach. The implication is that I believe in the nonaggression principle. That is no one can initiate physical aggression against another or his property. It is legitimate to everything else.This is why Im not interested in utilitarianism I dont disbelieve in social contract for any consequentialist reason. Even if it is more practical for a society to be governed by social contract that would not change my view that such governance is a violation of the natural law. I would read and respond to a utilitarian argument but I doubt that would change my mind as utilitarianism isnt the primary reason I believe as I do. My purpose of writing that was to streamline the discussion toward points that I find more persuasive to me.',\n",
       "  'counters': 'Go for it I believe that natural rights do not exist. All rights are a fiction created by people in order to agree upon certain core moral beliefs. Thats all.If were going to go with contract theory rather than the prevailing idea that a social contract is a descriptive explanation of the relationship between the government and its people rather than a prescriptive relationship then its pretty simply put that your parents agreed to the social contract in your stead when you were born by virtue of accepting your citizenship and getting you a social security number and when you reach the legal age of majority you are fully able to reject that social contract denounce your citizenship if you like. We already accept that legally parents can make decisions like this for their children or rather any guardian may make these types of legal decisions for their children and as such you for all intents and purposes did consent to the social contract. On the contrary we can point out that social contract is merely a description of the relationship between a government and its people. It never really referred to a contract as we understand it today. Your consent isnt inherently necessary for the social contract to be in effect. The consent of the governed populace insofaras its willingness not to reject that authority is what is relevant.'},\n",

You can also live off of crystal meth for a few days weeks at a time which as I understand it suppresses hunger. Just because it in fact holds down weight does not mean that it is superior. In fact a meth based weight loss regimen is inferior in every other possible conceivable way to diet and exercise. What about purging? Purging can control your weight. Purging is likely time efficient compared to diet and exercise. So instead of meeting only one criteria like meth based regimen it meets two. Other than that it is inferior in every possible conceivable way. Purging cannot improve mental health reduce cancer risk or improve sleep among many other things.

It would be a good bet that purging in your case is a symptomco symptom co condition of other existent mental health issues. Purging and related eating disorders often come with the incredible signs of denile and acceptance of the behavior as good on the individuals part. The admission of purging is an admission of the need for help. do not under any circumstances believe your own justifications for purging. There is no single reason whatsoever to justify purging under normal eating circumstances. You are calling it logic but it is in fact a clear case of denile and you justifying it.

Since understandably since you purge you will then CRAVE food?Honestly Im skeptical if you are actually healthy wieghtwise let alone not wieghtwise. If I had to guess Id imagine that you have body image problems of some sort. Thats pretty common with individuals with ED. I mean before you mentioned that you have a strict exercise regime in addition to your strict eating habitsbulimia tendencies. How can you be on a healthy path?Wieght isnt every thing. People tend to worry more about people losing wieght. But guess what. When you do NOT recieve the right supplements of nutrients then your body cannot maintain its metabolism. When it cannot maintain its metabolism then that means that it cannot carry out fundamental biochemical reactions in the body that do A maintain build neuron cells amongst a million other things. What does that mean? If you arent afraid of the horrible effects of your bodily health you will probably be afraid of the fact that your brain will effectively be deteriorating. Your body has to undergo entirely different chemical pathways to support itself when it is not fed properly. When some one is in starvation for example they release a lot of ketone bodies in the blood stream which makes every thing more acidic. Why is that bad? Because your body is more or less built on working on a neutral pH notice how water is the universal solvent in the body. But never mind your body I guess I will touch more on the organ that others have dismissed. That is the brain. Ketone bodies can pass the bloodbrain barrier. Do you know what prolonged exposure of those in your brain lead to? Coma. Death. Some bones might even break in addition since a very early onset of osteoporosis is so common with ED individuals.Also gonna throw in lazy bowel syndrome in there.Still dont get what the big deal is?

Here are the reasons Im against itOften times if a subject is in custody their only source of information about whats going on is their lawyer and those interrogating them. It can be extremely difficult to deduce the truth for a suspect. Often times police officers lie to try and get the suspect to give up information or confess in hopes of lessening punishment or explaining their side of the story. My argument is that such lies also encourage the suspect to confess even if they didnt do it to try and lessen the punishment. It also fosters an attitude among the public of dont trust a cop because you know they can and will lie if they think itll help their case whether its true or not.In regard to exceptions Im okay with the police lying in two situations. First if they are currently undercover in an investigation. It is obviously impossible to conduct such investigations otherwise. Second I would say lying is okay if they have reason to suspect someones life is at risk such as if a kidnapper has someone tied up somewhere and you need to rescue them. !',\n",

Without deception as a tactic another will be used. What needs to be changed is that attitude or behavior. Cops are frequently trying to get a confession or conviction as opposed to discovering the truth. Theres a multitude of reasons this happens often the cops in question truly believe in the guilt of the suspect but the bottom line is that the cops behaving in ways we the public dont like are usually doing so based on this assumption.

In other words it is a pure public good because it is nonrival and nonexcludable in fact it is the best and some would say only good example of a pure public good. The healthcare system on the other hand can be provided for by private organizations. There are of course reasons that the level of healthcare provided by the private market is too low or the prices are too high but it can be provided for on some level. Because of the inefficiencies of the market however it can be worthwhile for the government to step in and create a public system on some level. Because it is the government entering into an otherwise private market thats essentially what socialism by most definitions is.

       "  'counters': 'I have two different positions on this. One is constitutional and thus is only relevant to a discussion about the USA. The other is an ideological one. While I think both have merit I do not claim they are intertwined. The United States Constitution specifically identifies military as a duty of the federal government to provide. It does not give the government any responsibility for health care. And it does specifically deny the government the right to work on things that it doesnt specifically grant it the right to. So therefore by definition military is ok and healthcare is not ok. While you might not agree that this is a good thing my opinion is that as Americans we have an obligation to respect the foundations our forefathers established. If you feel the constitution needs to be changed they gave us a way to do that an amendment. Without it we shouldnt mess with it. And amendments are intentionally difficult to pass. Fundamentally there is a difference between health care and military. I forget the actual name of it but Im sure a more economically educated person than me can provide it. But essentially military is fundamentally a shared good. It isnt something that you can say person A gets more value therefore he pays more of the share. If you ask people how important defense is to them they will just say it has no importance therefore they shouldnt pay and will attempt to freeride on other peoples payment. Health care is different. I understand there are always exceptions to the rule so dont get too technical Im speaking in generalities. Healthcare can not only be personally identified and quantified but also personally affected. You can actually make it so that people pay for the amount of healthcare that they use. They can pay for doctors time they can be healthier or less healthy depending on how important health is too them. You can opt for inclusive or limited coverage. Etc. You cant do that with defense. You cant say well you benefited about from our national defense so thats your share. But you can do that for healthcare. Different people consume more or less goods and services. The problem is that since people view healthcare as an inherent right they dont see that it actually requires work from other people to receive it. Doctors time has a value and is limited. So is medical equipment etc. So while itd be great if we had unlimited resources we dont and therefore it is a capitalistic good and can be divided accordingly.

Im not convinced that rape culture exists in a significant way and I certainly dont believe that society is cultured to excuse rapists. To clarify I believe that rape culture hardly exists not that it doesnt exist at all. First of all sexual assault is punished severely. These long prison sentences are accepted by both men and women and I rarely see anyone contesting these punishments. It seems that society as a whole shares a strong contempt for rapists. Also when people offer advice regarding ways to avoid rape the rapist is still held culpable. Let me use an analogy a person is on a bus and loses hisher phone to a pickpocket. People give the person advice on how to avoid being stolen from again. Does this mean that the thief is being excused or that the crime is being trivialized?Probably not. Ive noticed that often when people are robbed from or are victims of other crimes people tell them how they could have avoided it or how they could avoid a similar occurrence in the future. In fact when I lost my cell phone to a thief a few years ago my entire family nagged me about how I should have kept it in a better pocket. Of course rape are thievery are different. I completely acknowledge this. However wheres the line between helpful advice and rape culture?. I think that some feminists confuse these two placing both of them in the realm of rape culture. Personally I do not think that victims of any serious mentally traumatizing crime should be given a lecture on how they could have avoided their plight. This is distasteful especially after the fact even if it is well meaning. However I do not think that these warnings are a result of rape culture. !',\n",

Obviously I cant speak for what everyone means when they use it but let me at least try to broaden the scope of the term a little bit.First off of course society explicitly expresses contempt for rapists. This isnt what the term means. Rape culture does not refer to explicit views. Instead it refers to the mixed messages that get expressed with regard to sexual assault harassment and consent. Here are a few examples Despite a strong intolerance for rape the notion of active consent is rarely an active discussion topic in books about how to teach your children about sex teaching them about the importance of consent is often not a strong priority. Despite strong explicit views about rape when highprofile cases of rape occur sometimes individuals are quick to excuse the rapists for other reasons e.g. celebrity status sporting achievements academic tenure notions of the victim deserving it because of clothing choices intoxication or past sexual promiscuity. Strong cultural norms regarding relationships and sex teach women to play hard to get i.e. say no when they mean yes and teach men to ignore initial negative responses to persuade women to say yes. As a source watch virtually any romance movie ever. Despite the fact that most sexual assaults are committed by someone the victim knows rape is often portrayed in a strangerinthebushes kind of way. This allows individuals who violate consent to consider themselves not rapists because they are not specifically targeting strangers.As I hope Ive made clear with these few examples the idea of rape culture is not about a culture that explicitly endorses rape. Its about a culture that says it abhors it while failing to change social norms and institutions that actually help to cultivate sexual assault. Note that this doesnt mean there are people out there that actually are trying to ensure that people are sexually assaulted it just means that out of ignorance or support of the status quo we as a society end up reinforcing these norms and institutions to our own detriment.'},\n",

       "  'arguments': 'I think its likely that primitive societies that allowed women to have an equal or dominating say in political matters were probably out competed by patriarchal societies. In this sense patriarchy may be a natural tradition. This does not imply that patriarchy is good or justified though.The reason I think patriarchies outperformed matriarchies is that primitive societies were in no position to compensate for the potential distortions in judgement caused by the menstrual cycle of women. PMS in particular has unpredictable psychological consequences for women. On the average it seems likely that men would be more consistent decision makers than women.Although men do not have better judgement than women do on average a man of good judgement is more likely to be consistent than a woman of good judgement due to the psychological effects of the menstrual cycle on the woman.And to reiterate I am aiming at an explanation for patriarchy with reference to the efficient cause not at a justification for patriarchy. To clarify what I mean by primitive I mean primitive with special emphasis on the sophistication of the societys psychological science. Societies that can measure predict or otherwise compensate for the psychological effects of menstruation may not have any use for the nofemaleleaders heuristic. Therefore the advance of psychology as science has potentially made patriarchy obsolete. Im not understanding the reasoning behind men are stronger therefore patriarchy yet. Surely there is more to leadership than being physically strong. Im sure Napoleon wasnt the the strongest bloke in the French army was he? If physically weaker men can become leaders why would physically weaker women have a problem?',\n",

This entire post is just a bunch of bio truthz made up shit that sounds right based on ones limited knowledge of biology and evolution.For instance you claim periods would make women unstable. In reality ancient women didnt even have monthly periods theyd only have about periods in their entire life. This due to the lack of nutrients and stability in ancient lives. Women only started having monthly periods in the modern world. Further men have a hormonal cycle just like women only theirs is a daily cycle of hormone fluctuations while modern women have a monthly cycle of hormone fluctuations. So hormonal changes are not exclusive to women.Finally all the actual historians and sociologists point to womens weaker physical strength in the might is right ancient worlds and their vulnerability during reproduction as the reason for patriarchy.'},\n",

       "  'counters': 'I want to take a crack at this. Before I get into the subject matter I want to build my ethos a bit to show Im not just making all this up. I do a lot of side work for Scott Horton the host of Antiwar Radio and The Scott Horton Show. Hes a longtime editor of Antiwar.com and most of what Im about to say I got directly from him just now.The first thing that is really important to note is that noninterventionism will not prevent every crisis. Not even Ron Paul would say that. It will however prevent escalation of various crises. You say that youre abandoning noninterventionism so a point that Ill keep reiterating is that noninterventionism is a more realistic and better foreign policy than interventionism. If you respond I challenge you to provide specific actions that should have been taken to resolve all of the issues you address ISIS Israel China and Russia.Ill take on the Islamic State first. The premise of your argument is that noninterventionists supported the withdrawal from Iraq in which was a bad move because that led to the rise of ISIS. Theres a lot to say here.. If the US had stayed in Iraq longer the ISIS would have grown sooner. The reason is that these jihadists thrive off of violence. They recruit by painting the West as the enemy. When the US bombs them it proves them true. When the US first started bombing them this summerCNN reported an uptick in recruitment Likewise if the US had stayed it would have given the ISIS another enemy to fight. If US troops really are bad for them why are they practically begging the US to send more troops? Its telling that most of their atrocities and all of their journalist beheadings have been propagated by them. This is empirically proven by what happened in a particularly bad year in the war. Search the El Salvador Option and James Steele. What happened is that the US began training Shia militias to fight the Sunni insurgency. A big partner of the US was the Badr Brigade. This ended up exacerbating sectarian civil war. Sunnis and Shias werent always killing each other it was the US that made it so. It was also alZarqawis big year.. If point is true what caused the rise of ISIS? The answer is really simple Obamas betrayal for the Mujaheddin in Libya and Syria. You know those moderates we hear about all the time? In Libya the moderate was Qaddafi. All the kooks lived in the east. When they came home after fighting in the Iraq War they were biding their time. When Hillary Clinton decided to pull a PR stunt and help Israel and the Saudis she got Obama to get rid of Qaddafi instead of watching Qaddafi kill them all them being the fighters now in Iraq. So basically Obama turned Libya over to little Osamas. Do I need to explain how that helps the Islamic State? The case is even clearer in Syria. Obama was arming the Syrian rebels. One can claim they were moderates but that was a sham the whole time. Obama even admitted it this summer when he called that a fantasy. Again he should have just let Assad the moderate secular one kill all the little Osamas. But no. Thats not what Israel and the Saudis wanted. So the US armed them with antitank missiles AKs and those Toyotas we saw ISIS driving in to Kirkuk and Mosul not to mention tons of money. . I would be remiss not mention that Bush shares most of the blame for killing Saddam and all of his sons. He killed off the moderate secular party drove the Sunnis out of Baghdad and installed the Shia government. Because most of the Sunnis were driven away the new Shia regime in Iraq had no reason to compromise and work with the Sunnis. This drove a lot of them into alQaidas arms. The point I really want to get across with these three points is this interventionism is what caused ISIS to gain power. It was not noninterventionism. How would interventionism resolve any of this?We need to have a talk about Israel.. Yeah supporting Israel was one of the reasons that Osama cited for fighting us. Thats Osamas letter to the American people. Read that. Read the reasons why they hate us. All of those reasons stem from US interventions abroad supporting Israel against the Palestinians supporting India in the conflict over Kashmir and supporting the attacks against Muslims in Lebanon supporting the various dictators in the Middle East UAE Saudi Arabia Qaddafi before we betrayed him and the list goes on. How does interventionism fix any of this?. Do you know why so many in the Middle East hate Israel hint its not because theyre Jewish? Its because they massacred Muslims in . They forced an exodus of Muslims in . They destroy Mosques They kidnap Muslims in the West Bank daily. They build electrical fences around Palestine. They force Muslims out of territories they have occupied for over years to make room for Jewishonly settlements. They just massacred hundreds of children in the Gaza Strip. Explain how it is moral to support Israel. If the US stopped supporting Israel they would be forced to stop committing all these atrocities and work with their neighboring countries instead of shoving their huge circumcised dick up the ass of any Muslim in proximity. How does lubing Israel up and strapping the Muslims down protect Israel from hatred and attacks?On Russia and China. Im not trying to paint them as saints but the threat of both countries is so hyped up. . By making economic strides for power do you mean liberalizing their economy after decades of communism? I thought the US liked that kind of thing. Sure theyre manipulating their currency but then again so is the US. Also if the Federal Reserve would stop doing that and if the government stopping messing up the economy with crappy regulations a bit redundant and high taxes Chinas economy wouldnt be a threat. . Russia only acted in Ukraine because the US has been intervening in Ukraine. The US props up the Nazi regime there No really Hitler loving Nazis. Search Right Sector and Svoboda.. The US installed the Nazi regime there. Really anything with Russia is the USs fault. Instead of extending a helpful and friendly hand to Russia after the fall of the Soviet Union the US played the sore winner and expanded NATO. Talk about kicking them while theyre down. If the US hadnt been expanding into Ukraine late last year well really in Russia wouldnt really be involved a whole lot. Also what specifically is it you think Russia did in Ukraine? I know this seemed kind of terse at points but I hate to see a fellow noninterventionist fall to the propaganda the US regime is constantly spewing. Once you cut through the nonsense perpetuated by the media you should realize that was a year that solidified everything Ron Paul and the other libertarians have been saying for years its time for peace. I look forward to reading your response to my arguments. I kind of assumed you know all about the background of Iraq Israel Russia etc. If I assumed wrong I would be more than glad to provide clarification.Note Ill be hyperlinking over the course of the next couple of days. If you really want evidence over a specific issue Ill be glad to make that issue a priority.'},\n",

Outside of our solar system it seems almost impossible for life to be completely nonexistent. Weve confirmed the existence of almost planets that dont orbit our sun and there are undoubtedly many more that we cant detect because our telescopes arent precise enough. Earthlike planets are also generally harder to detect than gas giants because theyre so much smaller.As to why we havent detected any signs of intelligent extraterrestrials and why they havent visited us yet thats an unanswered question see the Fermi Paradox Its extremely hard for the human mind to comprehend the insane distances between the stars. It goes without saying that travel between them would be extremely impractical and astronomically expensive. You then have to think about what would motivate an alien race to come and visit us. Our solar system doesnt have anything particularly special when it comes to mineral resources. Any species with the ability to travel here could undoubtedly maintain its own food water and fuel supplies by using materials that are much more accessible. Really the only conceivable reason is to contact us and then you have to consider how long weve been sending out detectable radio signals. The first highpowered radio broadcast was during the height of the Nazi regime only years ago. That means that any alien species would have to be less than lightyears away to know that we even exist and then to get to us they would have to organize a major interstellar space mission and travel all the way here. Contrary to what science fiction tells us space travel is unlikely to ever be what I would call convenient and there isnt really much reason to come here.Basically we dont know if theres intelligent life elsewhere in the universe. However we can say that there isnt anything on Earth that would make it more able to support intelligent life that doesnt exist on a multitude of other planets in our galaxy alone. Even places that we would normally consider completely inhospitable can support life see extremophiles It seems statistically impossible that were alone even if we havent met yet.'},\n",

When both of those occur together you end up with a populace that hates and fears the police rather than trusting and respecting them. Police officers have a duty to combat and possibly prevent crime. It is literally a part of their titleon any given day police across the nation will directly encounter every aspect of any given societys criminal elements from petty speeding violators up through massmurderers. Thats their job. Any given encounter must be treated as a potential worst case scenario if the officer wants to maximize his chance at survival. Granted most encounters are NOT worst case scenarios but that only magnifies the fear for cops. Its like winning the asshole lotteryi.e. is today and in particular this one stop the day that you win the asshole lottery and have to use lethal force in order to survive? Is today the day that you could die because you didnt respond accordingly? Normal human beings have a survival instinct. Assuming that police officers are normal human beings they must also possess the same desire to protect their own lives when they make an arrest of any sort. Thus they will judge encounters based on prior policing knowledge in order to gauge threats and will react accordingly to protect their own lives.Now Im not arguing that police can and do abuse power.

       "  'counters': 'Part of what made them more trustworthy to the general public before was a combination of a lack of information and the idea that in order to be a police officer there was more risk and responsibility due to the power held. If a police officer were to shoot me on camera for walking with a paintball gun for example odds are nothing would happen to him. If I am being arrested and Im on the ground and he decides to kick me in the head nothing will happen to him either. Well maybe hell get a bit of paid leave but thats it in most cases.Because police officers can get away with violence they see it as a first resort when dealing with people instead of something to use in case they need to defend their own lives or others.To go off of your argument point by pointActually no they dont. Im not saying that many police officers dont do this just that they can let you die and not do anything if they dont want to. There was a case where a man was breaking into a womans house and she called the police. The police told her they dont have enough officers on duty to help her and left it like that. She was raped and I believe murdered. This was a legal move by the department and while there is an understandable reason prevent lawsuits against illfunded departments that cant help everybody the language sets it up so that police dont have to help anyone they dont want to.I understand this one. Being a cop can be very high stress and deadly depending on where you live. But most cops arent in the middle of a mexican cartel shootout. Imagine if you treated every person on the street as if they were about to mug you. Youd probably want to go to therapy. Im not saying that cops should try and act like Santa when they pull someone over but to physically treat everyone like they may be a murderer is unhealthy. And its usually the people getting pulled over that wonder if they are going to die for not responding accordingly.If they have such an instinct to be violent with people who are getting arrested for any nonviolent crime then they are probably not emotionally stable enough to have the power of being a leo. I understand when they have a suspect who is being violent or resisting arrest that they would need to go that extra mile to appropriately detain them but that would not excuse treating everyone they encounter like a murderer.And as a final point I dont get what you mean when you say I should understand how to act with a police officer. I dont mean to assume but usually when I hear this its from people who think the right thing for everyone to do is to treat the officer like a king so you dont get shot.'},\n",

Cannabis? Magic mushrooms? MDMA? LSD? Anything nonmedical? If yes what did you think? If no why not?Here are some basic reasons to drink responsibly Wine and beer go better with food than most other beverages. You can enjoy food in a whole different way when you open up your palate. Alcohol helps you relax. Even just a first sip of a beer is psychologically relaxing. Part of the medical benefit is from relaxation iirc Alcohol is a social drug and it sucks to be the sober guy around drinking people. It also sucks to be the drunk guy around sober people or the very drunk guy around buzzed people. The negative effects of alcohol are relatively easy to avoid unless perhaps you have a family history of alcoholism or a tendency toward substance abuseYou do not need to drink and if you do you do not need to get drunk and if you do you certainly do not need to drink to the point of blacking out. If you are in your late s that type of behaviour is probably already looked down upon depending on your crowd.All I can say is that I was against drinking because my father was an alcoholic. I think I first tried it around and realized how harshly I had prejudged it. Alcohol is not bad it is a tool a drug like all the rest. If the user uses the tool badly we should not blame the tool.

       "  'counters': 'First I would ask why does there have to be a line? If you look at a color spectrum when does red become blue?The best metric I have is to look at what we value about life. Consider a parallel universe where we can upload your mind to a computer. Two people are in an accident. One persons body is in critical condition so they upload their brain to a computer and let the body die. The other persons body is fine but they suffered head trauma and are in a permanent vegetative state. They will never have a conscious thought again. Their body is there but the brain is basically shut down. In my opinion the second person is effectively dead while the first person while in a tragic state is not. The thinking conscious mind is what I care about here. I have no problem with pulling that person off life support. No one is going to feel the pain and whatever humanity would have died is already long gone. I would be against destroying the machine keeping the artificial brain alive though because thats a thinking conscious being and thats akin to murder. So to me its being a conscious thinking aware being that gives you value. This is a major part of why we value certain animals more than others. A dog is much more aware than an ant and an ant is much more aware than a bacterium. Thats why no one sheds a tear when you wipe down your counter with disinfectant. So apply this measure of value in the other direction. When an egg is first fertilized its just a cell. Its got no conscious processes going on. Its just like any other cell in a body just with slightly different DNA. Until the third trimester theres not much that can be described as anything resembling a consciousness there. I would argue this is around the time the immorality of getting an abortion starts being an issue but regardless the vast majority of abortions happen before this point anyway. So to answer the the title of your post its arbitrary in the sense that different people are going to have different ideas about what gives life value. But I think if you have a clear idea about that the definition of personhood can be derived pretty naturally from that. Its got nothing to do with whatever random line in the sand you choose like when the sperm hits the egg or when the egg implants or starts to divide or anything like that. It depends on what factor gives life value and I dont think many people would argue that having unique DNA is what makes a persons life have value.'},\n",

If you travel back in time do certain individuals not exist? The obvious answer is that people come into being at some point in timeTherefore personhood has a definable point in time. I did not exist before my birth year and my daughters did not exist or attain personhood before and . you cannot argue they have personhood now did not have it before those years and at the same time contend that personhood is indefinable.Since we now know that people dont exist before they are born or conceived for sake of argument and certainly do exist afterwards it makes perfect sense that personhood comes from not being....into being. It therefore follows that there must be an objective definition of personhood available to us that would satisfy almost all situations. There are obviously many ideas on this two of which I find persuasive.. The human mind is the most unique characteristic of human beings the thing that sets us the most apart from everything else. I do not agree with this argument but rather find it among the strongest available. It proposes that there exists a fuzzy line between nonhuman bundles of growing cells and human cells with the bare minimum capacity for thought on human levels. My philosophy buddy argued that in this fuzzy transition line lies the time of personhood attainement. He thought that perhaps the signs of being able to dream or better yet brain activity in abstract thought processing areas of the fetal brain served as a good guideline.. My favored argument but controversial because of its implications.I argue that as you have said human life begins at conception. I say this because it satisfies the two conditions in that statement human and life. We know it is human because the genetic code cannot be argued to be that of any other species and indeed is an individual of the species own unique genetic code. even identical twins have very very slight differences in their genetic codes on the order of a few base pairs but different no less. so that satisfies the human part. What about life? Interestingly enough some scientists have tried comming up with a definition of life for of all things space exploration. Their concepts have application for all biology however. I will note that there is some disagreement about these definitions but nevertheless they serve as a greatsolid foudation upon which to build our ideas of life. Life must satisfy the following conditions in almost every case . composed of cellcells . organizatoin think organsorganelles . engage in metabolism energy use . Respond to stimulienvironment possibly in a negative way . Living things typically growdivide there is some overlap with the next point . Living things reproduce . Living things adapt meaning evolutionIf we look at the two conditions mentioned human life a single fertilized cell satifies both of those criteria and the seven sub criteria that defines living things.

       "  'arguments': 'Every time I see a fire alarm go off it seems like people act exactly the wrong way and I can only think that its because fire drills are so common compared to real fires that the default assumption is that its a false alarm. When Im in class at university and a fire alarm goes off which is usually a couple of times a semester no one takes it seriously. The professor finishes their last thought while everyone takes the time to neatly pack all of their stuff before exiting the building often using the main exit instead of the nearest emergency exit. Similarly at my dorm last year they would run unannounced fire drills as often as once a month it was so common and the odds of fire so low that generally people just assumed correctly that it wasnt real and sometimes didnt even leave their rooms. Back in high school there were fire drill quotas so if the school hadnt done any for a while they would end up having like three in one week although in fairness in high school the teacher and administration made sure everyone followed procedure so if there was a real fire it would not be a problem in this case but I still feel like it helps condition people to the fact that fire alarms are false alarms. Finally about a month ago I was at the mall and the fire alarm starts going off but no one reacted everyone just went about their business as usual.With these examples in mind it just doesnt seem like anyone takes fire alarms seriously and I think people following any of these practices during a real fire would be disastrous. I recognize that knowing what to do during a fire is crucial and acknowledge that occasional drills are necessary but I think that unannounced drills are counter productive. If drills were always known about ahead of time then at least people would know an unannounced drill was something to take seriously. Also I think that drills are way too common at least in schools and universities in other places they seem far less common in comparison to real fires to the point that a fire alarm in a large public place has a chance of being false.I also realize that in the event of a real fire not panicking and creating chaos is probably more important than reacting as quickly as humanly possible but I still feel like the opposite reaction is pretty bad too. The only way I see people treating a fire alarm seriously is if they can physically see fire but in that case I think all of the training against panicking will go out the window anyways. After all experience under nonlife threatening drill situations hardly emulate life or death situations.I realize that all of the examples I gave were anecdotal but it seems consistent enough over dozens of experiences that I think I can use them in an informal argument such as this.',\n",

You have all the time in the world at this point but you just need people out of the building preferably without stepping on eachother on the way out.But of course fire drills need to be enforced to be effective. If an institution just turns on the alarm once in a while to fill a quota then they have failed. But I would say that those arent proper fire drills.So Fire alarms dont need to get people out of a building quickly they just need to get them out. Frequent enforced drills serve to get people used to the fire alarm and therefore not panic even in the event of a real fire. Fire drills where people arent actually lead out of the building arent real fire drills.'},\n",

       "  'titles': 'Some modern Libertarians hypocritically deny that Civil Rights are Rights',\n",
       "  'arguments': 'I believe the modern Libertarian as defined by people like Ron Paul is hypocritical when they dont support the Civil Rights Act. I believe theyve selectively refused to recognize particular rights for arbitrary reasons Its not in the Constitution! or for ulterior motives. The modern American Libertarian ascribes to particular rights. The right to privacy. The right of free speech. The right to property. The right to a fair trialModern American liberals add a couple more rights ie from the UNs Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The right to an education. The right to life. The right to equal protection against discriminationMany Libertarians however deny that equal protection against discrimination should be a Right. The modern Libertarian doesnt believe in protected classes that you shouldnt be discriminated against for your sex race and religion in terms of business transactions. Libertarians publicly acknowledge that racism is a bad thing... yet go ahead and declare that anybody should be allowed to actively practice racism in business and in personal life. I think thats hypocrisy. If you believe something is bad you should outlaw it. I believe stealing is wrong... thats why everyone has a right to property ownership and a fair trial. Thats why the Right to Property exists to make the world a more fair place and to promote a good where people should profit from the fruits of their labor. The Right to Property and the Right to Equal Protection are very similar in many ways. Both demand a change in behavior of people. In nature you are allowed to thieve and steal however you want. The Right to Property protects people from thieves. The Right to Property restricts your freedom to take anything you want. In nature you are allowed to discriminate and be an asshole however you want. The Right to be protected from discrimination protects minorities from private persecution. It protects people from being hassled and from being denied services for no reason other than stupid ones such as the color of their skin. Many modern Libertarians dont stand up for Civil Rights because they dont have the moral integrity to stand up for what is Right. Thats why they deny everyone else common sense positive rights such as the right to life and thus access to things like healthcare the right to education etc. They dont have the integrity to say that these things are good things that should be promoted by society. They instead give some bullshit about how the State has no right to interfere with our lives even in positive ways! Yet at the same time they fully accept the States intervention on matters concerning property or their own privacy. Why do people get to enjoy the states protection in matters of property but suddenly when it comes to Civil Rights state protection is suddenly out of bounds????TLDR I believe when Libertarians say that freedom from discrimination is wonderful but its wrong to force people to behave a certain way! is a copout. Its hypocritical to deny a Right because it requires government coercion when all Rights require government coercion to enforce. The state coerces you into returning stolen property it coerces you into attending your trial it coerces you to stay out of your neighbors backyard. Theres nothing wrong with government also coercing you into fairly trading with people rather than refusing them service solely because of racism or sexism.',\n",
       "  'counters': 'If you believe something is bad you should outlaw it.There is a difference between legal sanction and social sanction. I hate okra. I think its bad. I think that people with okra on their breath are encroaching on my happiness when they breath around me and have to smell it. So should it be Illegal? What if all the people in the north thought the same as me? majority of the population thinks okra is bad should it be illegal? No.The people who for whatever reason wish to eat okra have every right to do so if it makes them happy. Because its not hurting me and the cost is having men with guns attack capture and take people who eat and grow okra into cages and remove them from society. That is what we are talking about with legal sanction. The government only knows one way to handle law and that is with force. They would have to take money by force from people who like and dislike okra alike to fund operations to find people who grow transport and consume okra. People wont just stop eating the okra because they do like it and have no moral issue with it so they will risk men with guns kicking down their door to consume it. Not only that but there is a going to be a taboo about okra and status that comes to some people who do enjoy it. The consuming of okra very well might increase. Now lets look at corn. Corn is huge everyone eats corn and I love corn. God i love corn in everything. Now lets say that there are people who think corn is bad like i think okra is bad. Rather than make it illegal they make a large campaign that points out how much corn farming destroys the environment as well as how completely obnoxious people who eat corn on the cob and smack their lips all over the place are. They then come out with studys that show that corn leads to diabetes leads to kidney and liver issues and also are empty calories that lead to being just a fat ass. Now the corn industry will have tons of issues with this. They will fight tooth and nail to keep corn on the cob the main stay of every Americans side dish. Year pass and people see that corn really is bad to grow and finally see that all the smacking of lips and slurps are obnoxious. Other side dishes become more popular as replacements for corn and many places stop dealing with corn all together. The die hard corn lovers keep eating but their livers and kidneys fail and well they die off. within years the reduction of corn consumption is . Almost everyone stopped eating corn and those that do usually have to hide the fact or do it only with other people who eat corn. Finally with all the health issues insurance companys choose to charge more for people who eat corn and over all people who eat corn are shunned from society. No arrest not a single door kicked down.The first is a legal sanction the second is a social sanction backed by good ideas and hard data.Also i wasnt talking about okra and corn. I was talking about marijuana and Tobacco. I wanted you to see it from a outside view.I think a lot of the time when you see libertarians talk about things the legal sanction is perceived as the only means of sanction. Its not. I would argue that in the long term and most effective solutions are ones that are social sanctions not legal. So yes the KKK has every right to be racist but how many people look over their shoulder before saying anything racist? or preface things with Im not racist but. thats social sanctioning in action. It takes more time but is more powerful and overall more effective at changing society. Thats why libertarians are against the government engaging in social engineering. It doesnt work and usually makes the problem worse and in the process is creating more bad in the process. Libertarians also believe that the use of force is to be abhorred except in the defense of life and rights. So sending out gangs of armed men to try to force social change is just as bad as whatever the thing they are trying to change is. So your misunderstanding comes from not taking into account social sanctions and the power of society as a whole. It also takes away agency from the people to make change for themselves and places it in a bureaucratic machine which can only bring about change with the use of force.'},\n",

This however would be a very rare case as people allowed to immigrate should be more than intelligent enough to pass the citizenship test.On the other hand there would be a large number of natural born residents who cannot pass a citizenship test. They are simply not intelligent enough.The problem is that while tempting we cannot restrict the vote to the intelligent. First of all it would be a relatively small percentage of the population denied this right and they would likely have little sway in politics in any event. Second this path leads to madness because if it is acceptable to ban the very stupid from voting why not also ban those of average intelligence and leave the vote to the truly smart ones in society.Democracy is a shared acknowledgement that we are all in the same boat together and we should together determine the path it takes.

One is a movie one has a bunch of file folders one is an XBox disc one is just the most hardcore porn you could imagine etc. Now if Ive labeled them all or they all come with labels then I can distinguish the content at a glance. Despite all the data being different they are descriptively identical if I just say get me that DVD and point to the stack or if they arent labeled they wont know which DVD is which if I ask for Night at the Roxbury. Without knowing how Ive stacked them I might get the Night at the Roxbury or I might get Hardcore Anal Whores Return of Edward Dildohands. Similarly someones nationality isnt readily apparent so if someone asks me What does James look like? it isnt as relevant information if I say Hes American about feet tall big hands compared to Hes AsianAmerican about feet tall etc.More importantly though the idea wont have the effect you want. Lets imagine for a moment that you grew up in a time that didnt have a word for anything related to the male genitalia. Now if a guy slaps you with his dick you dont have the word to describe what just happened but that doesnt make your face any less dickslapped. For a more real life example after a senator in Arizona got shot there were people who were saying that we should remove violent words from school curriculum the media and the English language. At a glance it is obvious why this is absurd just because I dont have the word to describe a punch doesnt mean that I am physically incapable of balling my hand into a fist and swinging it at someones face. Hell most of my elementary school bullies were proof of that.There is a difference between noting that there are differences between people and discrimination. My friend Kevin is black. That is a thing he is that is a fact of the world just like my friend Brian is white and my friend Crystal is of Asian descent.

       "  'counters': 'Im always a bit puzzled by this kind of position. What kind of solution do you propose for this? How is it workable? Perhaps youre just asserting this as your view for part of a moral code that right action and behavior includes not referring to people as their race but only their nationality.As with most moral arguments that dont involve a legalistic element this one seems absurd to me. First of all you cant ever accomplish this its a goal that cant be reached this isnt damning in and of itself. But more importantly I dont think we could ever come close and that this is more akin to fantasy than reality. Secondly it ignores that however small there is some degree to which race as a concept is scientific. Radiolab did an excellent episode on this while race isnt a thing per se someones ancestry and the traits passed on therefrom can actually be read in our DNA. And you know... you can actually see with your eye that people have different physical traits. This goes beyond mere skin color people from different regions have developed in numerous different ways when it comes to physical attributes.So when you sayAll races will never be indistinguishable from each other.Furthermore this argument while riding the coattails of the current feelgood leftist understanding of humanity is actually rather disparaging to the differences between ethnic groups. Youre talking mere tolerance here and an attempt to reach a colorblindness that most even on the left would consider a pipe dream. What about nationalities with multiple ethnic groups with distinct cultures and identities? Look at say Iran. You have Persians Arabs Jews Turks Turkmen Yazidis and many many other groups. While such differences in ethnicity may not be important to us in the west with our cosmopolitan lifestyle in other countries your ethnic group informs a lot more about who you are. Simply calling a Turk and a Yazidi from Iran an Iranian would be reducing their identities to a level that even the two people in question would object to.Obviously people shouldnt be treated poorly because of their race or ethnicity but to me my ancestry and heritage are things that are essentially parts of my identity. I think most people feel the same way about their ethnic makeup. Not acknowledging this because it highlights that there are differences between mankind might avoid any possibility of discrimination cant discriminate against people who are different if no one is different! but it is a weakwilled way to look at the world. It attempts to remove the impediment to accepting everyone equally for who they are by denying that there should be any challenge to accepting others who are different because no different people exist.Well not only is that not true people at large will never be made to believe it so it is worthless as a moral theory. You cant impose this with legal force regulating the thoughts and beliefs of others isnt possible so it is worthless as a legal proposition. If it is merely your personal view on how youd like to treat others okay thats certainly one way to do it.But rather than ignoring the fact that we are different because weve developed different attributes because of a different heritage isnt really the way Id prefer to go. Id rather reckon someone who who they are isnt it nobler to accept them for that? Isnt it nobler to treat them equally even though you are different? Isnt it more worthy an undertaking to transcend and go above racial concerns rather than try to ignore that racial differences even exist?And frankly you can easily identify someone by the color of their hair. Your skin is the largest organ of the body covering most of your exterior which makes it even easier to identify someone by this trait. Why is it bad to say that black guy but not that blonde guy say if youre pointing someone out in a crowd? Id give people enough credit to be able to identify someone by a physical trait without developing racial hatred because of that.'},\n",

       "  'arguments': 'No I dont think that all people diagnosed with depression should just deal with it. I understand that depression can be a terrible thing that negatively affects your life in a number of untold ways. I also acknowledge that antidepressants can be an effective treatment.However I think that there are too few standards from separating depression caused by imbalances in brainchemistry and depression stemming from realworld stressors such as personal finance relationships career futures politics and much more.Here are the top three arguments I hear against my position and why I dont agreeImagine that you are k in studentcredit debt. Despite having a bachelors degree you make k annually see nearly a third of that money eaten up with taxes and nearly half of whats left gets spent on rent which is increasing annually. In the end you barely have enough to make your minimum payments. The cherry on top is that your boss brings home k annually and treats you like a peasant at work albeit when he isnt working from home.Every day you have to think about the future and how your current situation affects you. You have to think about futureyou. Your prospects are bleak some might say depressing. You cant just sleep it off or get over it because its not changing. The only thing you can do is try to earn more money pay your debts find a job that makes you happy etc.But instead you focus on how it makes you feel You determine you cannot eliminate the depression on your own so you get antidepressants.All you are doing is numbing the pain of the real world. You dont have a condition but you are depressed. The difference is that you are depressed for a reason and that depression might be what you need to motivate yourself to fix your problems. The pills just make you accept your fate rather than work for a brighter future. In this context they are complacency pills...No they dont. Its illegal to pay a doctor in exchange for prescribing people medications. Instead pharmaceutical companies do what lobbyist do They send doctors to seminars which is just an excuse to send them somewhere exciting for a week at an allinclusive resort all while bombarding them with marketing for the medicines they manufacture. They dont have take the companys advice buy your crazy if you think they arent influenced by the bribery.Not that it matters Doctors already find it easier to prescribe miracle pills rather than look for less risky treatment options. Though often pills are all the only thing a patient can afford as therapy is too expensive.The feelings of the patients are irrelevant as they are not doctors and they are biased. Some people truly need antidepressants and they shouldnt be denied it.That doesnt mean we shouldnt question the usefulness of these drugs when they are being prescribed more and more often many times as a first choice of treatment.These drugs have severe sideeffects including depression! Why risk screwing someone up worse when they actually can get over it themselves.TlDr The standards for prescribing antidepressants dont take into account whether the depression is chemical or circumstantial. Many of the arguments against stricter regulation are appeals to emotion not science. Now we have a lot of people on pills that just numb the pain of the real world which isnt much different than illicit drug abuse minus the high. However clinical depression does exist and some people do need antidepressants to function normally. These people likely make up a minority of those prescribed antidepressants to treat depression.NOTE Yes SSRIs marketed as antidepressants can be prescribed for a variety of other problems including medical problems that have nothing to do with the brain. I am not taking these situations into account only drugs prescribed to treat depression.',\n",

Its hard to sit down and figure out what to do when you feel like you are barely treading water. In regards to point Of course providers would rather prescribe drugs instead of therapies. Insurance reimburses very poorly for therapy and often times has limits like how many times you can see a therapist in a year. I wouldnt say they are bought by drug companies but our medical system is set up to favor drug therapies as opposed to other therapies. From my personal life I have been on antidepressants. It helped me get through a very stressful and upsetting time in my life. I was in counseling and doing my best to get through my life despite the emotional rollercoaster that had become my life. One day I was upset about something and I had the overwhelming urge to go home and cut. Thankfully I was still in a sane enough to realize that was not good. I took pills for a few months until I was stablized enough to not have that risk again.'},\n",

Deaf people lacking a fundamental sense necessary to drive should not be allowed to drive.Some more specific risks that deaf drivers pose source Talking with their hands when they should be on the wheel. Trying to lip read a passenger while driving. Not being able to hear emergency vehicles coming. Not being able to call for help if their car breaks down. Not being able to talk to an officer if they are pulled over. Not being able to hear warnings their car is giving them.The sole argument I have seen presented against this is that deaf people are accustomed to not hearing and are better at vision. But people who become deaf later in life are used to hearing so at the very least they should not be allowed to drive.

But you havent provided any evidence just suppositions that they are a danger and so there is an benefit to banning them. I am curious why are you picking on the deaf? People with glasses can get glare or dirty glasses. They are slightly less able to see than those without. Should they be banned from driving? People who had lasik eye surgery may have slightly worse night vision than those without. Should they be banned? Short people cant see around as well as tall people. Although a tall person crammed into a drivers seat has limitations too. Should we put minimum and maximum height requirements in? Verifiable statistics show that men are more likely to have serious accidents than women. Should they be banned from driving? If it have a cold I am not as aware as if I am completely healthy. Should you be banned from driving if you have a runny nose? There are all sorts of physical conditions and attributes that make someone less capable. We are not only going to let perfect people drive. For each type of thing we ban in drivers we need to judge if it is worth it or not. We should do so with statistics.

Given that it is designed properly the grade a child receives on a test should approximately reflect their understanding of the material and the cumulative score of their tests is what produces the final grade. If that is the case then why does it matter if they figured out say trig identities when the test was first given rather than a week later? To give them a grade that is not reflective of what they actually understand at the end of the course is to defeat the purpose of the evaluation itself. Im using test broadly. I think things that are typically called projects are generally speaking a type of test. I dont think that repetitious busywork should ever be factored in to a grade. Also in case it matters Im speaking from the experience of someone who went through the American public education system.I understand that grades also can be used to measure certain personality factors conscientiousness ability to follow instruction adherence to procedural norms which all debatable might be as important as understanding the material. However you could simply give a separate evaluation of these factors instead rolling them all in to one. Its been observed that performance at the university level corresponds better to standardized test scores than to high school GPA so it is helpful to have a grade that isnt a vague amalgamation of different factors. Note I set specific parameters in the title for a reason. I understand that a teacher might not have time to give endless makeup tests but surely they can manage a handful. I excluded college because I think that raises many questions about different obligations and the manner in which people separate based on ability.

That being said the basis of your argument is false. You and me both remember how distracting it was to go through puberty. Teenage girls are attractive. In fact from the perspective of any hormoneplagued young man in the prime of his young lust almost every teenage girl was nigh irresistible in high school. But my grades did not suffer for it. And any loose correlation between sexual attraction and bad work ethic is just a desperate excuse. The same is true for teachers. These are grown adults. Here is something else grown adults are capable of doing. Going to the beach. When Im at the beach the only shelter between my privates and the passing onlookers is a flimsy pair of swimming trunks. An erection would be embarrassing to say the least but according to your logic a boner would be compulsory nonetheless. After all a lot of women on the beach are wearing even less cloth than I am. If I am a slave to physiological imperatives why am I capable of doing anything when attractive women are around? I am not saying sexuality isnt a major aspect of human existence. But this notion that hot women are somehow distracting is exactly the kind of fetishism that arises in a country I am from the USA where prudish thinking is an epidemic that tends to repress sexual feelings to the point that they become pressurized and warped.

As it turns out he killed himself about a week after his elimination aired. Jesus Christ. That hit me like a ton of bricks. Here I was just wanting to find out the employment status of this competitor that I liked and I found out that he killed himself! After a little more research I found out that there have actually been two other suicides tied to Gordon Ramsays show. One was a failing New York restaurant on Kitchen Nightmares where Gordon yelled at the owner that if he didnt start improving his restaurant was going to sink to the bottom of the Hudson. After the restaurant failed the owner jumped off the Brooklyn Bridge into the Hudson and died. The second was a female chef on Hells Kitchen who killed herself shortly after her elimination aired.I tried to convince myself that this was bound to happen with the number of people that had been on his shows but even using my most generous statistics three suicides in the past four years of his shows is about x what would be expected from people in that demographic.Now I cant watch it anymore. I cant watch someone breakdown crying and get any sense of schadenfreude from it without feeling absolutely horrible about myself.

To even be considered you really have to be able to demonstrate that youre A character with a story. Any sane entrepreneurial cook could become successful with due diligence and proper know how so you already have to be mentally offset to get onto reality TV or even WANT to get on Reality TV in the first place. Secondly you have to consider the profession. Each profession has some nifty suicide statistics attached to it. For the longest time Dentists were at the top of that list because people rarely have a positive experience at the dentist and so its good luck to you getting patients and keeping your practice open. Highly stressful highly depressing situation. Now I couldnt find any particular statistics on chef based suicides however a quick google search will yield a higher amount of both drug and alcohol abuse among the cooking profession which needless to say can lead to depression. Factor in the environment of higher end cooks such as drug laden vegas and suddenly the picture is a little more clear.Lastly add in other regular statistics like male depression and suddenly being a chef is a volatile place to begin with.Yes Ramsey may have been the straw that broke the camels back but he is certainly not guilty of making these folks kill themselves. Even then its still not immoral because as I understand he doesnt ever tell someone to kill themselves in the first place and in simple realistic terms a well reasoned rational human realizes that a lost opportunity is not the end of the world its something to be frustrated over sure but definitely not worth offing yourself.'},\n",

I love going to church on Christmas Eve night and singing Joy to the World and praising the Lord for sending us our eventual savior. Apart from religion Christmas to me means family and every year I get to spend time with both sides of my family. I see grandparents and cousins and aunts and uncles that I normally dont get to see throughout the year. I also get to spend more quality time with my immediate family which is sometimes hard to do with busy schedules. To many people Christmas is about the presents and although that shouldnt be the main point I would never deny the fact that it is fun receiving gifts from people who are close to you and vice versa I enjoy giving people I love gifts and seeing their excitement upon opening them. I love the story behind the commercialized version of Christmas including Santa Clause and his reindeers and elves. I especially enjoy watching Christmas movies about Santa and all other Christmas movies in general. It has become a tradition for many families to watch Christmas movies each night leading up to the th. Christmas cookies and hot chocolate are also an essential part of Christmas and I love both making and eating Christmas treats. Any holiday that promotes baked goods is a holiday I support.

I was raised Jewish and did not celebrate Christmas so everyone making a big deal about Christmas quickly got annoying and felt excluding. Hearing Christmas songs constantly on the radio seeing decorations everywhere and hearing everyone say Merry Christmas. for a month or two every year is a repetitive reminder of This is our thing not yours. As far as Christmas day itself goes all it means to me is a day where normal schedules get disrupted and there is nothing fun to do with my new free time because almost everywhere is closed and people are busy. While it is a stereotype it is true that I usually end up seeing a movie and eating Chinese food.Hello I dont get the Christmas spirit when I hear the songs on the radio and I hate it when radio stations only play Christmas music. There has been times when I choose to drive in silence rather than listen to the radio. I wouldnt mind it if it was just the day of or maybe the week of Christmas but is usually lasts a month or two and I get sick of it.Of course I cant argue against a holiday being the best without suggesting a holiday that is better. So here are the holidays that I consider distinctly better than ChristmasFourth of July Traditionally celebrated by setting things on fire and setting off explosives at the base of your driveway. A pyros dream holiday. From a more spiritual side I consider our mastery of fire to be the only thing that truly distinguishes humans from the rest of the animal kingdom. I use the Fourth of July as the day to celebrate this because it is already traditionally celebrated with such a large use of fire.Thanksgiving This is the holiday that holds for me the same feeling of family that you ascribe to Christmas. However it doesnt have the downside of excluding myself and all other nonChristians because it isnt a religious holiday. I especially like the tradition of opening your home to those that dont have anyone else to celebrate that year. And having the NFL play all day is nice as well. Overall this is the holiday that I think is a great holiday for the broadest range of people.Chanukah While it is a Jewish holiday it does have its things that are fun. The presents part of the tradition is basically the same as Christmas but there is more to the holiday than that. There is also the week of lighting candles which is fun for a pyro like me. Seeing a room with candles on each menorah and menorah for each member of my family burning at the same time is quite beautiful. There is also the fact that any food fried in oil is a traditional food of the holiday. The most used food for this is latkes a potato pancake but things like donuts and french fries are also considered traditional foods of the holiday.Super Bowl Sunday Not an official holiday but something that a large part of the country celebrates anyway. American football is my favorite sport to watch so the grand championship is a big deal. It usually involves large groups of friends getting together and enjoying a wide range of snacks while watching some of the greatest athletes in the world. The game itself was a bit disappointing this year but overall still a great event and I liked the implications of the results on the future of the league.The World Cup Final Similar to Super Bowl Sunday just a sport I like slightly less but on a larger scale and less often.The Olympics especially the opening ceremony Similar to the Super Bowl and the World Cup but with a broad range of athletes of just about every type imaginable. It also has a large emphasis on the world community and the celebration of multiculturalism. I love seeing how the host country chooses to show off their culture on the world stage when the get the chance. You get to see how the country views itself and how they want to be seen. Also there are some sports that dont really have another event that is worth watching so the Olympics is the only time to watch some of these athletes and events.'},\n",

Yes some fatacceptance movements go way off the deep end but this specific campaign is pretty damned benign. Its not saying its okay to be obese its saying its okay to love yourself even if youre not perfectly fit.

Does everyone have time for all of that? Nope. Your priorities are valid for you. My priorities are valid for me. Neither one of us gets to make that call for anyone else.Finally about a month ago the major news outlets picked up a story about how fatshaming doesnt work heres the Washington Post article but if you Google fat shaming doesnt work youll see links to a bunch more. So if telling people that theyre fat and disgusting doesnt work... maybe telling them that theyre worthwhile will? You object to the campaign telling people to love their bodies but dont you take better care of the things that you love?? If you think your body is worthless shit why would you care what you put in it? And conversely if you love it wont you be more likely to take care of it?Overweight people are already surrounded by endless messages of youre disgusting and youre lazy and youre worthless and youre weak and youre stupid and so on and so forth. Tell me how well is that working on a societal scale? How well if that curtailing the obesity epidemic? Weve already tried it your way and that way doesnt work. If youre really serious about combating the obesity epidemic as opposed to basking in righteous superiority wouldnt you be open to trying something new just on the offchance that it may actually help? You know the saying the definition of insanity is trying the same thing over and over and expecting different results.As an aside and to preclude any sort of ad hominem replies let me just say that I was overweight but dropped lbs last year and am now in the optimal weight range for my heightage. I try to be active but going to the gym is not an option for timemoneyattentionspan reasons. I do feel better physically and emotionally and would definitely recommend it....

These commercials portray women who are supposed to represent what real beauty is. The eight or nine women featured are of average height and vary in skin tones but are all curvy. None of them are what people would consider skinny or thin. I dont think anyone would label them as athletic or incredibly fit nor would anyone say they are obese. My issue here is that many people have tried to convince the world that no matter what size you are youre beautiful and should love your body. That being said this commercial shows one type of body rather curvy and maybe even verging on slightly overweight. Is real beauty not being thin even though you may happen to have a high metabolism or eat healthy foods? Is real beauty not being athletic or strong or muscular? Are we saying that its okay to have extra fat on your bodies because no matter what size you are youre beautiful? I realize that many people cant help what size they are no matter what they do and Im not saying that being stick thin or anorexic is okay either and I dont agree with modeling agencies that promote models being underweight.

Calling your parents mom or dad isnt just a sign of respect it is sign of love as well. Mom and Dad are titles that parents have earned by having and raising kids. Parenting is an extremely hard job and parents deserve respect. Another time I was very bothered by someone not calling their parents mom or dad is when my friend was talking about something nice her mom did and addressed her by her first name in the story. Regardless of the setting you should continue to call your parents mom and dad to show your ongoing respect for them whether youre out of the house or out with friends.I also believe that using Mr and Mrs when addressing those older than you or authority figures is an absolute must. I also know of people who prefer being addressed by just their first name because the title Mr or Mrs makes them feel old. They have insisted that even children as young as call them by their first name. Feeling old is fantastic in my opinion! It is also a natural part of life but it is also something that one should be proud of. It shows that you have lived and you are wiser than I am. It shows your level of knowledge is far beyond mine and that you deserve respect from me. Furthermore this also creates a problem later in life when children make calling adults and respected figures with higher statuses than them a habit. It is so disrespectful and hurts those who have earned these titles that demand respect.NOTE I am addressing the matter of people who prefer to have titles before their names and children who repeatedly forget to use the title or ignore the title altogether. Also just because I think adults deserve respect for being adults DOES NOT MEAN I DO NOT RESPECT CHILDREN. I love children and hope to dedicate my life to them as a pediatric nurse. I am also so I am writing this from the perspective of a child as opposed to an adult.NOTE My title and thesis for this post was too rigid. If i could rename it I would omit the words never and always.

Most of the income of very rich people comes from unearned income such as investments and interest. They didnt work for that money.

If youre rich you can afford to get the laws written to benefit you. Investments are reinvested to produce more unearned income ad infinitum.Now that thats out of the way the recent phrase You didnt build that is true and what it means is that no person lives or makes money in a vacuum. We live in a society and in the United States that society has myriad ways in which it supports individuals and companies who want to make money. Here is a short list A legal system that enforces contracts. If someone can walk out on a deal without repercussion business wont go well. A legal system that protects investors and investments. Why invest in a proposition if there isnt a legal structure protecting your money or your rights? A legal system that enforces general order in the populace. When the lower classes revolt such as Occupy Wall Street you can have the handily militarized police keep them in line and arrest them or break it up if need be. And they did! Infrastructure. You cant get your goods to market without roads or trains. You cant have a stable website without a federally researched and funded basic infrastructure. You cant sell air conditioners as well if there are rolling blackouts across the country every day. Regulation. Government regulations for food safety clean water clean air etc. all instill confidence in the populace to buy goods. Look what happened in China with the melamine in the baby formula welloff Chinese parents imported foreign formula rather than take their chances on local manufacturers. Protection. I already mentioned police but theres also fire fighters and of course the military. And dont forget FEMA flood insurance and all forms of disaster relief. Communication systems. I already mentioned the internet but remember we also have a cheap and efficient mail system stable electric system etc.Without these services and protections provided by the society at large businesses would not be as profitable and many wouldnt even begin. The taxpayer builds the roads and fills the military and pays the judges and any wealth gained by using those systems arose not just from a businessperson or business but from society at large and in order to maintain those systems and support everyone involved a good chunk of that wealth rightfully belongs to society at large.

Youll probably have to settle for a lower ranked medical school if its any lower than that.If youre looking for work in engineering internships are an absolute must. In fact it reflects badly on you if you have a large amount of classes but minimal practical experience since it implies that youre not wellrounded. If not internships then at least undergraduate research is needed. Ive talked to a professor who used to manage a company and he told me that he once had an applicant who had straight As through undergraduate but minimal practical experience and he rejected the applicant straight out because the guy obviously had ample time to do actually useful things but instead spent all his time on classes.And another thing about internships and undergraduate research succeeding at these are far far more fulfilling than succeeding in classes. In classes problems and projects are usually designed so that they complement what you learned. When you do internships or research youll find that the things you did in class feel a lot more contrived and fake because of that. Youll be getting a depth of knowledge and work on solving actual problems.And if youre looking towards graduate school this is the thing I can speak most about since Im in it you absolutely need undergraduate research experience to get into even a mediocre graduate school. The graduate chair at my graduate school told our group before our interviews We dont need someone that can fill out a test. What use is someone who can fill out a test?

Additionally many people who need emergency care will not have the time or ability to price shop. And even people who do have the time may not know or understand what they need or what the hospital offers. For example a list of medications would be thousands of items long.

I however think that they would not be that much of a burden as you can give them some water and leave them alone plus theyve probably spiced the party up with their antics for two hours beforehand.Basically I believe a party where everyone is too drunk is much more desirable than a party where everyone drinks sensibly even if it results in sickness.Side note an argument that references health will not .

       "  'arguments': 'Before I get into my argument here are my caveats I fully believe that some moms truly truly cannot afford to stay home and must go back to work but I believe this is a small percentage of the moms who say things like I really wish I could stay home but we just cannot afford it. Specifically single moms are of course amazing. Most of the moms I am challenging with this post are in twoadult households. I am not saying that all moms should stay home with their children. If a mom justifies going back to work because she doesnt really enjoy staying home great! Go back to work and know that you are being totally honest with the world and yourself. If you have any other reason for going back to work other than some version of we cant afford for me stay home great! Have a great career! You are not to whom this post is addressed. I know that I am being terribly gender exclusive with my language. I fully support dads that want to stay home. In reality though I have never met one. Every person I have heard give the cant afford to stay home line was a woman. In reality though my argument would be just as valid if a couple considered the dad staying home but concluded that we just cant afford for him to stay home. I personally see value in a mom staying home until all the kids are in school. To me I do not see much value for the family in her staying home after that. BUT THIS IS TOTALLY MY OPINION AND IS IRRELEVANT TO MY ARGUMENT. I dont really care if you think moms andor dads should stay home or not. I only care about why they believe they are not staying home.Here is the core of my argument. Many women convince themselves that they really want to stay home with the kids but that their current financial realities over which they have no real control will not allow them to do so. Essentially they are convincing themselves that powers outside of their control are dictating that they must go back to work.I believe that for most families who use this line this is nonsense. There are usually options moving to a smaller houseapartment or a cheaper town cutting expenses going out to eat less cheaper vacations consigned clothes cordcutting etc.. Due to all kinds of cultural pressures of which so many of us are largely unaware many families legitimately feel like they cannot go without cable TV cook dinner for themselves each night go on cheaper vacations etc.I know that this post sounds incredibly judgmental. To be transparent if you couldnt guess already my wife is a stayathomemom SAHM with our month son. She worked in a great career until our son was born. When she had been home for a few months technically on maternity leave from work people began to ask whenif she would go back. When we said that she would be staying home we were consistently met with the same reaction Oh thats wonderful! I really wish that I could stay home with my X kids but we just cant afford that. Often the dad was making more than me! What? I started to get annoyed. I was not angry because these moms went back to work do whatever you think is right but that they were all giving us really crappy rationales for their decisions. If you want to go back to work so that you can stay in your nice house go to the Caribbean every few years and eat at the nice restaurant in town a few times month thats cool just say that. If on the other hand you went back to work because you just felt like you had to and never really considered making the kind of lifestyle i.e. economic changes it would require then thats really sad.Ok reddit change my view!One quick note I have never done one of these before. I tried to be honest and direct with my view given the point of this forum. I recognize that it sounds pretty snobbish and well mean. Please be assured that I never really talk this way when having an actual discussion about this stuff with working of SAH moms.',\n",
       "  'counters': 'Many people have covered the idea that you cant judge someone elses finances so Im not going to go into that even though it is key here. There are two other points you seemingly havent consideredWhat is the cost of having the mom stay home? Finances are not just a numbers game a huge part of financial stability is being in a place where you feel happy and emotionally healthy. If having the mom home would cause a decrease to the point where the family is suffering then they literally cannot afford to have the mom stay home.For example people go on vacation to get a break not just because its a thing to do. How much will it cost the family to avoid this? Its generally easier on a mentalemotional level to have disposable income is forgoing all or most of this convenience worth the mental stress? What will the mom do to get metime and how much will this cost?Its very easy to tell people to cut things out but unless youre talking about specifically jobrelated things now you wont pay for the commute for example its not quite that simple.What are the longtime consequences of this action? Youre suggesting that moms take years off of work. At the end of this time their ability to get a job will likely be significantly diminished. This is compounded in situations where there are two or three kids in short succession. Trying to get a job after years of unemployment is challenging in all fields. If the field relies heavily on networking it can be next to impossible. If the mom works in a field that changes constantly five years can put her seriously out of the loop to the point where she may need a few months of updated training and certification before she can get employed. Its a bit shortsighted to assume that just because they can possibly afford to this in the right now that its a sensible and practical decision for the long term.'},\n",

And a lot of smart people like Christopher Hitchens have said the same thing so I dont want to completely chalk it up to Reddit being Reddit.Anyway I got into this site through ratheism and lurked there for two years before making an account and realizing that there were far more fresh and interesting subs out there. Suffice to say Im not coming at this issue with a we must respect religions even if their adherents do terrible things attitude. Because . . . . I recognize that terrorism as we usually think of it is disproportionately Islambased.. I recognize the phenomenon of people in a firstworld highly developed society suddenly becoming radicalized in the name of Islam and plotting terrorist activity or travelling to join alQaeda or ISIS.But as I see it this can all simply be explained by the fact that the part of the world that is most predominately Islamic the Middle East has been fucked with throughout the second half of the th century. Political social and economic disorder breed radicalism see postWWI Germany which found a convenient home in Islam. If Islam hadnt been there or is removed in the future I think radicalism would just manifest itself in the next big thing nationalism racism politics etc..Up until the midth century Islam was widely regarded as one of the most peaceful and tolerant religions out there. And if the Middle East were traditionally a Christiandominated area and the West traditionally Muslim there would probably be people right now beheading journalists in the name of Jesus.As for satellite terrorists in firstworld countries I see it as an inevitability like the Americans who became Nazisympathizers during WWII. If an ideology is powerful enough it might lure in a small number of idiots elsewhere. Its bad but its not unique to radical Islamtheres no hypnotizing verse in the Koran that turns people into terrorists.Im not making a defense for religionobviously it can be a vehicle for hatebut in this case I think its just the most convenient vehicle in a long line of them. So if you could wave a magic wand and Islam would disappear something else would rise up to take its place.What do you think? I dont really want to dislike Islam but I sometimes feel like Im being overly tolerant if thats possible.',\n",
       "  'counters': 'Youve way oversimplified. First you need to define what boundaries you are putting around what counts or doesnt count as being Islam or cause related to Islam or a problem of Islam. I think you are equivocating a lot around that concept.For example do we abstract out levels to generalizations or leave it as specifics. If for instance instability and backwardness of the region is largely a result of Islam particularly the fighting between factions of Islam as well as between Muslims and nonMuslims in the region does that count as being a problem of Islam or is that a problem of religion in general or of innate tribalist ingroup outgroup tendencies? One might say it is all of these things. Except that not all tribalist tendencies result in this type of situation and not all religious disputes result in it either. But sometimes it does. Does any of that matter here since we are in fact talking about Islam only here. Sure we could argue about some hypothetical other religion in the region causing similar problems but that hypothetical world is not this world. In this world it is Islam that is the problem in that region. And indeed it is Islam that led to much of the problems in that region. Much of it used to be far more advanced with men and women more free before more fundamentalist Muslims collectively gained power.By your reasoning we can explain away just about everything. There was nothing wrong with Naziism then because all it did was exploit existing Lutheran antisemitism in the region that led to the Holocaust. Had Naziism not done it some other belief system would have so lets stop blaming the Nazis. As youve even stated Political social and economic disorder breed radicalism see postWWI Germany. Therefore Naziism isnt a problem either. How is that any different?To be of explanatory value you need both causal relationship and predictive power of unique features leading to that relationship. For example Hitlers parents having sex had a causal relationship to the Holocaust but it has no predictive value. We cant know somebody had sex and predict it could lead to a holocaust. We can however look at Mein Kampf and predict that this sort of thinking in power could be very harmful.The same is true of Islam. If you actually read the Koran and see how people in the region interpret it you can predict the harm it will cause. Sure its not guaranteed. And it isnt the only thing to consider.But lets turn the question around the other way. Imagine two cases In Case everybody agrees with you that Islam is not problematic. In Case you change your view and everybody agree that Islam is problematic. Now other than those words written on the page what realworld practical difference does it make in what you or anybody does? Keep in mind we still have the Islambased terrorism you agree to in both cases including firstworld radicalized Muslims. What does inserting the word not mean in practical terms. If its just all an abstract concept then this is all just meaningless academic masturbation.For me the practical difference is whether there is value in promoting secularism as a cure for the ills of the region that religion is a source of their ills that religion is in fact wrong and in efforts to show people of the region that their specific beliefs are what lead to this harm that Islam at the current time is particularly prone to radicalization. To convince a rational person to do something evil requires convincing reasons on why it is somehow a good thing to convince a religious person you merely need to convince them that their god wants it. Certainly fundamentalism of some religions is a problem but even moderates set the stage for fundamentalism as enablers they extol the values of the koolaid which the fundamentalists then drink.So is it tribalism? Yes. Is it religion? Yes. Is it Islam? Yes. And tribalism is just the natural selection result of game theory economics of groups fighting over limited resources. So we can blame nature and economics too. Where does the buck stop?'},\n",

I have noticed it is very hard for upper middle class students to find ways to fund college. Schools give out little grants to them and the government gives out even less. This however is justified in my opinion. There is only so much to give out. On the other hand I found private scholarships to be the most frustrating. Every single one that I applied for was based on financial need. My academic and philanthropic resume didnt matter. All that was looked at was how much my parents made. I am not suggesting that I should attend college for free. I shouldnt. However there should be more ways for middle class students to help aid them. Many times poorer students get money from the school and government and then from private scholarships. I believe there should be better ways for middle class students to find scholarship money to help them pay for college.',\n",

Lets examine a study done by the Institute of Higher Education Policy. they found thatThis suggests that middle school students do receive private scholarships. However you may have experienced anecdotal evidence stacked against middle class students because there are private scholarships out there that are need based. For example the Gates Millennium Scholars Program requires eligibility to receive a Pell Grant.However The National Merit Scholarship Program sponsored by the National Merit Scholarship Corporation gives scholarships to students based on their performance on the Preliminary SAT which actually favors higher socieconomic classes because students from wealthier families do better than students from less wealthy families.There are a lot of private scholarships out there and many can be hard to find but there are many that favor wealthier students. In general poorer students are less connected and have less resources to even discover what scholarships are out there so there is probably a greater effort to reach outadvertise to those students by the private organizations that provide the scholarships. So it might be that middleclass students need to exercise their resources to find the lessadvertised private scholarships.The main difference is that wealthier students tend to perform better academically because they have a more supportive and resourceful family structure have better access to technology and can receive costly tutoring can afford standardized test fees I know very smart students who couldnt afford to pay for AP tests even though they could have scored highly and dont have to work part time to support their families instead of devoting more time to studying.While poorer students should receive more aid proportionally than wealthier students access to better higher education should be made easier for everyone in general across the board.Source'},\n",

       "  'counters': 'To treat time as a valuable resource time is money is smart. But it doesnt seem like youre treating time as a valuable resource that you have to allocate carefully youre acting as though you have unlimited amounts of time to squander on your professional goals.Imagine if you treated your money the same way you are treating your time. Imagine instead of spending money on food and rent you starved yourself and lived in a homeless shelter so you could invest in the stock market and have more money in years. When you have more money in twenty years what will you do with it? Would having slightly fancier food and a slightly larger mansion in be worth starving and living in a shelter in ?Or conversely think about balancing food versus rent. It might be worth getting a slightly cheaper apartment to eat out more or eating more ramen to move to a nice neighborhood but its not worth being homeless to eat Beluga caviar around the clock.These are the questions we ask ourselves about our money. We need to spend it on various important goods so we dont want to fritter it away mindelssly or squander all of it on one project past the point where spending it on that project makes us signifcantly happier and healthier.You say youve been treating your time like money but it sounds to me like youve squandered it. You needed to allocate your time between work study professional development health rest friendships family and various passions and hobbies. Education can be an important investment. But so can friendships. An hour a week watching movies or eating dinner together may turn into a lifelong friend and ally who will be with you through thick and thin. Treating time as money means you need to both buy or invest in a BA and also buy or invest in friends. Spending so many hours buying your degree that you dont have any hours left over to buy friends is wasteful.'},\n",

       "  'counters': 'I would like to think that you are correct in your expectations of the Chief Technology Officer route. One important aspect to consider is the sheer amount of time you have to develop your career.If you are trying to make your first million by age X or be the youngest Y in the field of Z then you dont But honestly who cares?Unless you have an outrageously specific life goal in mind like developing the cure for some disease or going to Mars then you really dont have to focus so intensely on the time component by itself.Consider the following scenarioYou view time as equal to money so wasting your time is wasting your earning potential. This has prevented you from socializing making friends enjoying your existence. However this mindset has also obscured potential opportunities for you that you may not normally be exposed to.You may find that by traveling to Nicaragua on a vacation it strikes you that you can develop an easy solution to some problem you see there. Or perhaps after having some beers with some people in a hostel in Germany you realize that the your niche expertise in your field of technology is underrepresented in the German market and your efforts there could advance your career at a faster pace than what you can find in America. These are just examples. The main point is that you have arbitrarily chosen one limited route and done the costbenefit analysis on that choice alone without taking the time to consider a wider array of options.Circling back to your time money scenario this expanded worldview allows you to retain your instilled sense of the value of time but can show you that you are Wasting your time by only considering one life path even if there are others that could lead to a higher earning potential and better enjoyment of life.Additionally ask anyone in the business world about how EVERYTHING works and they will all tell you that personal connections are hugely important. By not making personal connections and not building social and professional networks you are pigeonholing your career potential. You may have the Ph.D but what happens when you are going up for a position against another reasonably qualified person whom the recruiter gets along with better? You will miss it.So if you need to you could actually recategorize your time spent socializing as job training because no one would argue that social skills are irrelevant in a leadership position. They are essential. So stop wasting your time and go have fun and socialize with people you will need the skills later.'},\n",

Now these terms dont seem to be recognized by any major dictionary but from their usage it seems to mean that a Gnostic atheist faithfully states that there is no God with a sense of certainty while an agnostic atheist says that there is no God but we dont have proof? Ive yet to have someone really clarify this in a way that makes sense to me. Heres the thing if you state that there is definitely no God on your faith alone that isnt Gnostic atheism that is just atheism! If you say we dont have proof but there is probably no God that falls within agnosticism. If you say there is no proof but there is definitely no God yet this somehow isnt a decision of faith i dont think there is a particular word for that because you are talking out of your in a sense there. So maybe agnostic atheism is the word to use here but it is a corruption of both words in this case. Some anticipated counterpointsWe should let people label themselves as whatever they want. No because this confuses the argument and not only makes it difficult to understand what the other person is trying to say and to state things clearly yourself it allows dishonest commentators to constantly say no you havent proven me wrong because Im really this ad nauseum. The current definitions are too broad. We can easily narrow them down by saying I am an agnostic who believes our existing knowledge makes God almost impossible but we dont have the evidence to prove the theory of God wrong instead of misusing words which already have a definition and causing confusion. Agnostics have no doctrine so they cant say that there isisnt a God which means there needs to be a word between I just dont know and atheism. I think this is the strongest argument as doctrine means principle or belief and isnt necessarily limited to a yesno binary dynamic. Still it seems much clearer and more logical to say Im agnostic but there is probably no god than to say Im an agnostic atheist so there is no god but there is also no proof but this isnt a matter of faith. Agnostic atheism seems hypocritical to me. Also see the Socratic definition below. Also those people who do identify and use these words properly shouldnt be forced to relabel themselves simply because internet goers got it wrong. Its also unclear whether most people get the word wrong or if its just the reddit community and a few other forums. Id love to see information based on academic texts or politicalnews discussions. .....I truly welcome anyone to correct my definitions of Gnostic and agnostic atheism. As I said i couldnt find official definitions and Ive only heard the terms used online so Im basing their definitions on that context and my own limited analysis. Otherwise change my views here that atheism is a hard beliefdisbelief and agnosticism is the soft version and that gnosticagnostic atheism is a misappropriation of these words to create definitions which already exist as other words and that this is harmful to clear honest discussion of the topic.At the moment Im getting mostly down votes for a post I put a lot of thought into and have commented on every response to. Are you down voting because you disagree with me or because you think Im unwilling to change my view? Also no one has so far addressed anything beyond what is the correct definition of these words today. The point that the original definition of atheist was binary has not been challenged nor has the idea that binary is clearer. Some people have said that the definitions used on ratheism are the ones real atheists use but have given very little evidence of this. Im open to that idea but since the dictionary which reflects real language use all academics Ive spoken to and nearly every atheist Ive met in person all use the classic definition I havent been given any reason to think it extends beyond reddit and the writings of Richard Dawkins. I argue back hard and ask you to give me evidence but provide that and Ill happily change my view. I do acknowledge that of the major English dictionaries Oxford does include lack of belief as part of its definition of atheism for the US and Britain but that is also inconsistent with its definition of agnosticism in its US English section. It seems Dawkins and other modern writers may have had a pronounced effect on the current definition in the British entries in the Oxford dictionary. The other major dictionaries do not seem to include lack of belief only disbelief. My view is also changed in that several important groups and a significant number though not all of individuals define themselves by the inclusive definition of atheism which is a spectrum not binary. This type of usage really does change the definition of the word even if it makes it less clear. Conclusion atheism should be officially updated to be inclusive based on widespread use and self identification with the term in discussion it is best to clarify how youre using the word from the start or avoid using such charged language I still believe the inclusive definition is unclear and technically incorrect but those drawbacks are outweighed by colloquial understanding and selfidentification in most contexts. Bonus Im still going to call myself agnostic but you can call me atheist if you feel like it.',\n",

I want to suggest that you change your view from what it is to instead be that using the word atheism at all is bad for clear honest discussion.As basic evidence I cite all the nonsense in here all the misplaced arguments regarding the definition of atheism. I think the myriad miscommunication surrounding this word is apparent here and in regular discourse. Using a word that has such a vague colloquial meaning even if the dictionary has a definition is bad form in communication if you think it is likely possible that your conversation partner may misunderstand you. Better to use terms that lead to conversation rather than semantic derailment.I think Sam Harris makes a good point in this video I usually go for the vague word nonreligious if it comes up as people tend to ask questions not assume positions. Better than calling oneself anything negatively defined would be using something positively defined like reasonable. Better still is to not even a label just say I believe ideas once I am convinced by reason and evidence. If pressed they can say no such reasonable evidence exists for any deity so I do not believe in any or I believe that there is evidence against ltdeity Xgt so I believe that ltdeity Xgt does not exist. Everyone understands and noone wasted time talking about definitions of words. Ultimately discussing the words is a waste of time and is bad for clear honest discussion better to discuss the actual ideas. This form of discourse is also less aggressively received since there is no initial negative connotation to ideas like there often can be for words atheist and agnostic.

Agnostic atheism seems hypocritical to me. Also see the Socratic definition below. Also those people who do identify and use these words properly shouldnt be forced to relabel themselves simply because internet goers got it wrong. Its also unclear whether most people get the word wrong or if its just the reddit community and a few other forums. Id love to see information based on academic texts or politicalnews discussions. .....I truly welcome anyone to correct my definitions of Gnostic and agnostic atheism. As I said i couldnt find official definitions and Ive only heard the terms used online so Im basing their definitions on that context and my own limited analysis. Otherwise change my views here that atheism is a hard beliefdisbelief and agnosticism is the soft version and that gnosticagnostic atheism is a misappropriation of these words to create definitions which already exist as other words and that this is harmful to clear honest discussion of the topic.At the moment Im getting mostly down votes for a post I put a lot of thought into and have commented on every response to. Are you down voting because you disagree with me or because you think Im unwilling to change my view? Also no one has so far addressed anything beyond what is the correct definition of these words today. The point that the original definition of atheist was binary has not been challenged nor has the idea that binary is clearer. Some people have said that the definitions used on ratheism are the ones real atheists use but have given very little evidence of this. Im open to that idea but since the dictionary which reflects real language use all academics Ive spoken to and nearly every atheist Ive met in person all use the classic definition I havent been given any reason to think it extends beyond reddit and the writings of Richard Dawkins. I argue back hard and ask you to give me evidence but provide that and Ill happily change my view. I do acknowledge that of the major English dictionaries Oxford does include lack of belief as part of its definition of atheism for the US and Britain but that is also inconsistent with its definition of agnosticism in its US English section. It seems Dawkins and other modern writers may have had a pronounced effect on the current definition in the British entries in the Oxford dictionary. The other major dictionaries do not seem to include lack of belief only disbelief. My view is also changed in that several important groups and a significant number though not all of individuals define themselves by the inclusive definition of atheism which is a spectrum not binary. This type of usage really does change the definition of the word even if it makes it less clear. Conclusion atheism should be officially updated to be inclusive based on widespread use and self identification with the term in discussion it is best to clarify how youre using the word from the start or avoid using such charged language I still believe the inclusive definition is unclear and technically incorrect but those drawbacks are outweighed by colloquial understanding and selfidentification in most contexts. Bonus Im still going to call myself agnostic but you can call me atheist if you feel like it.',\n",

The Four Horsemen and Horsewoman generally defined atheism as being without belief although Hitchens and HArris were particular fans of New Atheism which wrapped rationalism and skepticism into the mix with atheism. American Athiests  disagrees with your strict definition as well. CARM and other religious ministries general throw dogmatic atheism there is no god and skeptical atheism I see no evidence for a godyour godgods therefore I refuse to spend energy believing in a godyour godgods under the same blanket definition. Wikipedia where almost everyone will go before going to a dictionary has this to say when broadly addressing the subjectEvery atheist podcast I listen to defines atheism as lack of belief. Frankly Im not familiar with any mainstream atheists who would define atheism strictly as a dogmatic rejection of deity. In fact application of Russells Teapot would put dogmatic atheism firmly in the category of irrational and extraordinary untestable claims which is at odds with mainstream atheism. You keep referring to the dictionary definitions but frankly those arent the honest marker of the usage nor is your strict reading of the verbiage the most honest way to proceed. If were gonna scrabble itSO already we have two definitions from your provided source. is dogmatic.Now lets look at . The disbelief in the existence of a supreme being or beings.So rewritten atheism can also be defined as the the inability or refusal to believe or to accept the existence of a supreme being or beings.

Not in standard anyway. The big reason that was despised is that the Start button on the taskbar aka the way most people accessed all of their programs is no longer accessible at all. All you have is the start screen with the tiles. So yes if you dont want to clutter your desktop youre forced to interact with the tiles and many people dont like that UI and for good reason they arent using a tablet. That metro UI works wonderful on tablets and Im definitely picking up a Windows tablet because I want a tablet where I know I can use most of my desktop apps that arent games. You touched on this ha I am punny in your OP the problem is that if you are not on a touchscreen that UI is complete garbage to work with compared to a start menu and a lot of people dont have touchscreens. I believe that more people will as time goes on.You might not miss Windows and backs start menu. Thats fine for you but a lot of computer work is based on habit and repetition. If Im used to clicking on the start menu and going to my favorite list of programs switching to Windows means a lot of retraining and frustration and why should I even bother?That said I dont think I can change your view.

However as an IT pro who also does ITtype stuff as a hobby and a gamer to boot I spend a lot of time with my computers and having a usable UI is paramount. Windows was clearly designed around tablets which is fine but what works for tablets for UI design doesnt translate to mouse and keyboard. Imagine using iOS or Android on your desktop and tell me that Apple would benefit from switching from OSX to iOS for their operating system on a Mac Pro even though you dont like MacThese two things are mutually inclusive Windows does not exist in a vacuum. You cannot say that Windows is bad or good without comparison in any meaningful way because if Windows were the only operating system it would be both the best and the worst operating system ever quite literally. So it is entirely valid to say Windows is bad because Windows is better as long as you back those claims up. To use a metaphorical example Im going to use chess The pawn is not a very good piece. Theyre essentially your cannon fodder to sacrifice to keep your better pieces alive. But if every piece in chess was a pawn they wouldnt be the worst piece anymore. Therefore pawns are bad because other things are better.

       "  'arguments': 'Ive just watched this collegehumor video about racism. Yeah it Collegehumor but it clearly has a serious intention. Its very short but the point Im focusing on here is at .DISCLAIMERNow Im from Europe and where I live quite a small village we simply dont have and therefore dont know most of these issues at least not to that extend. Infact most of us are white. Many muslims especially Turkish but they dont stand out that much either. So it this offends you be considerate and think about being in my shoes with a different society. Browsing through reddit I noticed oftentimes that remarks that immediately sound racist to americans are perceived very neutrally here. We do have foreigners being from Italian descent Im a foreigner in Germany myself but I dont look that much different to Germans. Yet sometimes I get asked if I run a pizzashop just because Im Italian and many Italians actually do have a restaurant or sell ice cream or something like that. That is not considerate to be racist or offensive here. But Im here to hear you out from a US perspective. END OF DISCLAIMERAnyway I was surprised at some of the examples in the video. I know its the point to show people that theyre being racist while not even realizing it. I get it. But I have a hard time seeing whats wrong about excluding a race in your sexual preference. Now if the argument is that its racist because Im actually making a difference depending on the race then why is it OK to be sexist making a difference on gender? If the argument to that is Well you didnt choose to like women men but you choose to dislike a race then wouldnt we start to ride a socialjusticerollercoaster that would continue on to other minorities traits or features? Not OK to dislike dating Redheads? Not OK to dislike dating elderly people? Not OK to dislike dating handicapped people? Until we get to our final destination that sounds like you just dont wanna date her because shes ugly! Youre discriminating ugly people.Maybe you say its racist because such a statement would express that I think all e.g. black people share a common trait while they dont necessarily have to meaning its racist to pigeonhole an entire race. But then again whats the deal with doing so? For all that matters the term asian black hispanic is putting people into drawers already so thats racist already no? Again I hope not to offend anyone. After all I might be just somewhat ignorant because I dont live in a diverse society like the US. Maybe Im missing what exactly is the taboo here. Maybe its just taboo to say it but its ok to think like that?? I dont know. But doing a little research I also found this asian girl to call herself racist because she refuses to date guys of her own raceI just think that IF we call this racist and put the blame here onto people not wanting to date a certain race then we would start blaming people to be discriminating others for every aspect watering our preferences down until we truly like everyone equally. Note my point isnt so much this isnt racist but more the issue that resolves out of blaming people for their sexual preference even if it comes to someone never wanting to date a certain race. So Im genuinely curious this is my first post on rchangemyview and Im open for a new opinion if you could explain me Why should it be called racist to refuse to date a certain race given my arguments above If it is racist why wouldnt we end up blaming people for refusing to date gingers elder or just ugly people? And finally Arent we all entitled to any of our sexual preferences without needing to justify them?',\n",
       "  'counters': 'Im mixed black and white my wife is irish. My kids are as white as fresh snow. Technically my kids have black genes in them that would put them in the the same category that some people would never date a black person. If you would not date one of my children solely based on the fact that I am their father which I clearly look African American you are a racists. If you wouldnt date a black person because you just arent attracted to dark skin which coincidently I also am not attracted to to a certian degree. I am attracted to black women with lighter skin tones because thats what I would prefer. But if a really pretty dark skin toned woman with a nice personality was attracted to me I wouldnt totally disregard it. So the question is would you never date a person that is black because they have black skin and no matter how attractive their other qualities are you couldnt date them or just because you have had a certian experience with a small group of people that happen to all look alike you think they are all the same which would make you racist.'},\n",

       "  'arguments': 'Equality is one of a number of concepts referenced regularly in Western political discourse others being freedom fairness and so on but Im increasingly troubled by the pursuit of it in politics.Usually people dismiss this objection as a confusion between equality of outcome and equality of opportunity. The former is something I rarely hear supported but is at least unambiguous in its meaning everyone has the same life quality in terms of health wealth education etc. Only people with a view of the world heavily slanted towards nurture believe this is possible and most accept it is beyond the remit of government to achieve it so far as I can tell.But equality of opportunity despite appearing to be meaningful at first glance is actually nonsense or at least as ambiguous as equality. Does this mean starting everyone from a same footing which would involve compensating for background and genetic discrepancies or simply applying the same provision to everyone? I dont view it as within the power of the state to arrange human affairs so that every child can have an equal chance of prospering at school and even if it was possible I think the destruction of freedom and family life it would entail would be deeply wounding. On the other hand spending the same resources on every child seems equally callous squandering talent at the top while potentially not allocating enough to the disadvantaged at the bottom. As for the legal system equality could seemingly apply to equal rules applied universally regardless of background factors class character etc or attempting to compensate for those factors in the name of fairness. I think theres probably elements of both approaches in our legal system which limits equality to a principle of not being spuriously discriminatory on grounds of race sex and so on. I suppose Im more of a basic standards kind of guy believing there should be a minimum amount of education health and housing that the state should endeavour to provide but otherwise citizens should be left to it. That seems to me to be justifiable for reasons of decency rather than equality. .',\n",
       "  'counters': 'Yes but the ambiguity you suggest is exactly why there can never be a correct answer. This is an optimization problem with a moving target imperfect measurement and disagreement over the relative weights of metrics to be balanced in the optimizations.I usually describe it this way equal opportunity is a level playing field and impartial referees equal outcome is a tied score. Everybody supports a level playing field and impartial referees and essentially nobody supports a tied score regardless of talent effort or value because then there is no incentive to put in effort.Fine. But what if the tilt of the field is tied to the score the higher your score the higher your side of the field is making it easier for you to score. What how do you make such a game fair?This feedback loop of score to tilt models the ability of wealth to make you wealthier you have a higher percentage of your wealth that can go into earning you investment returns with no effort on your part and get better investors to give you better returns all as compared to people with less wealth. Also being born into wealth means better education better health care better inheritance better opportunities and so forth.So what is fair and equal? I think a Rawlsian veil of ignorance approach works best here. If you were popped into existence somewhere in society but dont know where youll show up race sex social status wealth what rules would you put in place. This consideration goes for everything from law to economic policy to social policy.After decades of understanding complex system behaviour I am convinced by the mathematics and dynamics of system behaviour that the optimization must be some form of compromise that involves the equivalent of constantly releveling the field and diminishing returns on scores meaning each metaphorical goal is worth less and less the more you score. Your score goes up but smaller amounts each time.This translates in reality to things that result in some redistributions progressive taxes for social services and safety nets perhaps some affirmative action style promotion but only in cases where underrepresentation actually affects the future of the group underrepresented tilt of field and other forms of equalizing outcomes.It does not mean that the raw gender gap in pay needs to go to zero but where it does not there still needs to be some means of keeping say men from getting a higher and higher percentage of the societal wealth over women because that tilts the field. If the gap is due to women having children and harming their career there may need to be some benefit given to those women directly. Not to completely compensate tie the score but at least to relevel the playing field.Yes these mitigation solutions do come with economic costs as well as benefits but that is the nature of system optimization there will always be tradeoffs and imperfections in any single parameter. Designing an airplane for steady flight loading means it will fail upon landing and designing it for landingground loading means it will be inefficient in flight. You cant have it all.Some compromises are very hard to deal with. Affirmative action may mean putting less qualified people into roles and more qualified people suffering as a result. How do we fix that? Effectively were taking a statistical system property of peoples traits and using it to benefit and harm individuals. Thats not a very fair society possibly violating the Rawlsian consideration. But doing nothing results in a tilted field so how do we best compensate? There is no ideology that has this optimization solved. Ideologies are the ingredients not the recipe. Ultimately I agree with you but rather than dismiss the opportunity vs outcome nomenclature I think it is more useful to embrace both concepts and talk about how they are invariably linked and the solution has to be a weighted optimization somewhere between them.'},\n",

Mike Tyson was famous for intimidating opponents before the fight. Muhammad Ali used his celebrity and political clout to affect the psychological issues inring as well as using his inring skill to influence things politically. I think this puts the strategy involved in boxing as being at least comparable to that of American football.As an aside though it seems that Football coaches are not terribly good strategicallyWhile the game might be strategic if the coaches play an orthodox style and ignore the subtle strategy what good is the game having strategic depth in the first place? Chess has a ton of strategic depth that doesnt mean that chess novices display any appreciable amount of strategy.I think skill is the most difficult to quantify but what I will say is that boxing unlike football requires a wide variety of skills footwork form endurance strength etc while football players are more specialized.I think that this shows that even if American football has slightly more skill the lack of strategic depth and lower athleticism make boxing a far superior sport based on the criteria youve given.'},\n",

       "  'arguments': 'In the past few years an idea has been going around that robots and computers will eventually replace all jobs because they will be able to do our jobs faster cheaper and better. The narrative goes that once that starts to happen on a large scale people who are not part of a small privileged minority who own the means of production will see a dramatic and permanent decrease in their quality of life. This view is probably best presented by this fantastic video Humans Need Not Apply To be clear I am not arguing against the idea that robots and computers will someday replace mostall existing jobs. Im arguing against the idea that it will make us less well off and nobody will be able to find a job.I disagree mainly with this views long term conclusions. Eliminating jobs through technology can only result in a society with more wealth for everyone. In my opinion thinking that large scale automation results in a lower standard of living for most people shows an ignorance of economics and a failure to take into account all the effects automation would have in the long run. Here is my reasoning...First lets look at how improved technology benefits an industry and some examples of what thats looked like in the past. Its fairly easy to show that in the near term automating away jobs in one particular industry benefits everyone else while harming the people in that industry. When refrigeration started becoming widespread ice suppliers were soon wiped out while everyone elses quality of life increased dramatically. Yes ice suppliers used to be a thing. Over the past years longshoremen have found themselves less and less needed while everyone else enjoys cheaper and more reliable oversea bulk freight resulting in cheaper... everything really. Also note that there was a lot of political outcry because of both technological improvements. People saw jobs being eliminated and talked about how the new technology will make everyone poorer. They were wrong of course.In the long term the harming of a particular industry ceases to be a problem because the industry gets replaced by new industries with different jobs jobs that result in better lives for people than the old industry ever did. Instead of ice suppliers we have the jobs in other industries that the increase in efficiency of refrigeration allows being able to refrigerate things for much cheaper and for longer caused a boom in a lot of other industries such as farming transportation restauranteuring food and beverage manufacturing etc. Not to mention the people that make and service the freezers that replaced the ice suppliers. In all more jobs were eventually created by refrigeration than refrigeration replaced. And up to this point in human history this is what all technology has done in the long run. Every useful invention so far has made our lives better.Most people who hold the view that future automation will harm most people respond along the lines that its different this time because technology wont replace one industry but nearly every industry. First of all this view generalizes the negatives without generalizing the corresponding positives... namely if nearly every industry is automated away we will see a corresponding increase in quality and quantity of nearly all goods. And the corresponding plummet in prices. If the production of a car from mining of raw materials to assembly to sales is all automated how much will that car cost? A lot less. Secondly and most importantly this view looks at job elimination and assumes its permanent. This is nonsense if history is to be our guide. In the new hypothetical world of abundant dirtcheap quality goods and services most people will find some new way to make a living. Just because we dont know what that way is doesnt mean it wont happen.Note that I dont necessarily think that automation wont hurt some people or make some people poorer. I think that this will happen in the short term and we ought to come up with some support system for this. But in the long term automation can only help. years after that dark time things will be looking different. years after things will be amazing.Though I feel strongly about this subject now I am definitely open to having my view changed. The idea that automation will hurt people in a long term way seems to be pretty widespread but I havent seen any convincing arguments for it that take all the effects of automation into account.',\n",
       "  'counters': 'The problem with the historical examples you raise is that they are isolated one industry disappears but a new one replaces it something you yourself noted. However with full automation there is no such thing as an unskilled labor force anymore while you could simply educate everyone beyond the gap this has several fundamental issues associated with it. First at least in the US we have a political class that has a severe hate on for public schooling at least two of the likely candidates for the Presidential election Rick Perry and Rand Paul advocate eliminating the Federal Department of Education entirely and they are taken seriously on this matter. With rising costs associated with higher education and a dilution of the marketplace by for profit institutions we are having a serious issue insuring both the quality of education and the availability of the same to those who arent in ideal economic circumstances.Second in any sort of fully automated economy there just wont be enough jobs to go around. There are already nearly job seekers per every open position in the US and thats not considering qualifications population growth or the eventual loss of jobs via automation.Why is this an issue? Because like you noted when the only people in any sort of economically beneficial position own the means of production everyone else suffers. Were slowly eroding the social safety net in this country and actively trying to reduce the amount of taxes corporations and wealthy individuals pay which is the equivalent of a river that suddenly loses its headwaters the output keeps going until the system is drained but with no input suddenly only the people at the mouth of the river have any water.Finally with how the political system in this country is favoring oligopolies monopolies and anti competitive networks of all kinds theres no longer any reason for businesses to compete to lower costs because costs of production have gone down. Look no further than the collaboration between publishers to fix the price of eBooks which have infinitesmal publishing costs compared to realbooks and yet still cost essentially the same if not more. Caps on mobile data increasing costs of broadband without a consistent increase in bandwidth not to mention skyrocketing costs of content in the entertainment space are just a few examples where presumed costs savings due to technological advancement are not in fact being passed on to the customer.All of these things and more will cause automation to drastically alter the economic landscape of this country and presumably other first world countries as well.'},\n",

I posit that this doesnt make a difference. As the world moves to more and more mobile formats responsive sites apps more featureful phones saying that videos have to maintain the old ways is borderline curmudgeonly. Its akin to saying that you cant send tweets or use snapchat because I still use email and I cant read your messages with Gmail.A phone is more naturally held in portrait mode and so taking a video that way is going to be more common.

       "  'arguments': 'I come to to defend and perhaps have my view changed on the following statement Belief in most contemporary religions such as Christianity Islam and Judaism is innately and inevitably harmful completely indefensible and due to these reasons should be made a criminal offense.My opening statements in the of this view are as follows. Contemporary Religions Cause Human Rights AbusesAll contemporary religions instruct their followers to conduct abuses of human rights as part of their religion. Contemporary Christianity when followed based on exact instructions rather than its spirit that is general guidelines and recurring themes which are presented throughout the Holy Bible instructs its practitioners to kill maim and torture anyone who happens to violate its codes. While truly literal Christians are a rarity even in the most fundamentalist circles largely due to syncretic difficulties with the currently existing laws and not because of a lack of motive to be even more extremist it is extremely common among more fundamentalist Christians to engage in such things as sexualorientation based discrimination child abuse and worse. Other religions such as Islam are just as bad or even worse in this respect. Some would argue that not all Christians are like this but.... If There Is Religion There Will Be FundamentalistsAs society begins to leave its spiritual and superstitious roots behind and move on many who are raised in or have found religion leave behind fundamentalism and become more moderate or liberal. This may even extend to the point where the strict moral code of the religion is left behind and instead the religious belief is used for moral support or emotional uplifting. If we could just get all the fundies to follow in their footsteps wed be golden right?...The answer is no. As long as there are Christians even in the loosest sense there will be a few who open up their Bible and read what it has to say. Some of those people will convince their fellow Christians to become more fundamentalist. Others will simply become radicalized by themselves becoming potential lone wolves. In any case the further from Biblical morals their society is the more fault they will see with it and the more anger they will express. This anger could be expressed in highly nonproductive ways a la Eric Rudolph. The only solution to this problem seems to be completely eradicating all traces of offending religions. Now one could argue that this would bring about backlashes definitely from the fundies and likely from the less strict religious and perhaps even nonreligious human rights protectors who so valiantly guard the freedom of ideology they cherish but that is also not a total stop to this because.... Were Already On Our WayThink about how much progress developed countries have made away from religion in the last few decades. We have successfully removed religion from places where it is neither needed nor wanted such as schools in many cases. Of course there are exceptions many classrooms are still religious in nature and there will always be the religious folk who dont partake in such heathenery and instead homeschool their children so they can receive the necessary dose of brainwashing but we have made a ton of progress. Despite the protests of the angry fundies this is not poised to slow down stop or reverse at any point in the remotely foreseeable future.. Does It Violate Freedom Of Expression? Not ReallyFreedom of Expression like all rights has its limits. The right to speak freely doesnt apply if you knowingly accuse someone of a crime they did not commit. The right to bear arms doesnt apply if you are manufacturing weapons of mass destruction. And similarly people cannot be allowed to hold irrational views which cause damage to society.Think about it like this. A person who believes black people are inferior to white people can go his entire life without ever committing a hate crime. Even though he considers black people his inferior nothing about this views compels him to ever kill steal from or even refuse a job to a black person. His view is irrelevant but it might predispose him to actions which can be dealt with separately.Compare this to Christianity. The Bible actually encourages its followers to commit abuses against human rights in many different forms. Because of this a person who sincerely believes in the Bible is compelled to perform this actions and harm others in doing so. The fundamentalist cannot reconcile these syncretic difficulties and he is forced to obey his religious text over the law of the land because he cannot reconcile his beliefs.. There Is No Evidence Any God Of The Contemporary Form ExistsAll these human rights abuses would be acceptable even necessary if it was proven that the God of the Bible or the Quran or the Torah was a real entity. However not one shred of legitimate scientific evidence has ever been unearthed which would show the existence of such an entity. Instead we are left with selfcontradictory texts which make many untrue predictions to the point that anyone with even a moderate degree of knowledge of both theological and proper scientific fields could not reconcile its absurdity without resorting to willful ignorance. Most believers are ignorant in the traditional sense in that they do not even know what they are truly supposed to be believing.End. ConclusionContemporary religions are all irrational belief systems that are almost certainly untrue. They violate human rights by their very nature and society would make significant progress if religion could be outlawed without unmanageable social backlash. Therefore our opening statement is true.',\n",
       "  'counters': 'I do believe that it is absurd and ridiculous to make something illegal based on some fragment of a subset million of a population of billion which itself is a subset of of humanity. Basically its like deciding humanity is bad because there is such a thing as a psychopathic sociopath. Its not not all Christians it is that essentially no Christians. And however rare fundamentalists are atheists are rarer. The cure is far worse than the disease. For every case of us having a problem with politicized religion there are hundreds or thousands of cases where we do not. Making rules for the outlier is a good way to get that rule changed. There are zealots of anything. Some people prefer simple world views and pursue them with absolute devotion. There are such zealots in every field of human endeavor. Eliminating religion would change literally nothing in this regard they would simply hook their star to a political pundit sports team or philosopher and continue unabated. So theres no real gain in converting a fundamentalist Christian into a Sovereign Citizen or a Roma Ultra. In fact fundamentalist Christians are obligated to contribute to social welfare via the corporal works of mercy its entirely probable that by eliminating the religious obligation to care for the poor youd end up with even more destructive variants of zealotry with even less in the way of redeeming qualities. If we are already on our way to some kind of grand atheist future why do you so desperately want to fuck that up by creating condition in which religion has traditionally thrived? Just look at the surge in religiosity in former Soviet Satellite States? They became significantly more religious the more they were oppressed. It looks to me that trying to accelerate secularization with force of law would backfire badly and that any legal action would have to wait until after the public closer to religious than atheist.Moreover its important to note that the only reason public schools exist in the United State was to ensure that kids could read the bible this is made painfully clear by the original MASSACHUSETTS EDUCATION LAWS OF AND I wouldnt say neither needed nor wanted back then but as Religious Freedom was developed it was revised to a secular structure. The big win there wasnt for atheism but it was a free society. I just dont understand how State Atheism is materially different from a State Religion. In both cases you are making it the states job to change how people think which is inherently backwards and sets an incredibly dangerous and essentially medieval precedent. It most definitely does violate essential freedoms more accurately if we are already on our way and the secularization of public schools were big wins for Atheism then why completely destroy the mechanisms that are allowing the of Americans who selfidentify as Atheists According to this Pew Survey to win over the of the population who identify as a member of an organized religion. Youre talking about a massive majority to accept fewer freedoms to give the State the Power to support the agenda of a miniscule segment of the population.You have not demonstrated that Christians are more likely than nonChristians or that religious individuals are more likely than nonreligious individuals to actually commit human rights abuses but are expecting me to accept this is true as an article of faith and then proposing that we should allow the government to coerce people into agreeing with the political and social goals of a small segment of the population. Wouldnt this create a situation where fundamentalists benefit by actual persecution and becoming some of the leading voices opposed to an obvious overreach of government policy that disadvantages virtually everyone and would be opposed by virtually anyone? In fact the most extreme fundamentalists pray for a misstep like that as it would cast them for real in the role they imagined for themselves. Why is this relevant? We have a portion of our brains dedicated to creating an emotion of spiritual significance religion arose as the natural consequence as a reasonable result of the signals we receive from our own brains. Weve seen it happen in brain scans and we have seen it artificially induced by experiment brain tumor and epilepsy. Gnosis and therefore religion is real and exists regardless of the accuracy of claims regarding any given deity.Moreover there are a reasonably large number of people who reconcile religion and science including both clergy and scientists. I would argue that those who adhere to the thoroughly discredited conflict thesis are people who cling to willful ignorance of the methodologies that allow for the distinct forms of human understanding to be reconciled because its convenient for their narrative and because it affords them a justification for feeling superior.Counter conclusion Ultimately passing laws restriction religious freedom have a long history of backfiring. This proposal is especially so because the religions that predominate thrive under state suppression as evidenced by cases such as Sovietdominated Poland the population is still overwhelmingly religious and would react poorly to being repressed by a minority that already is claiming to be getting what it wants the ban would not work as expected as the problems it is purported to resolve are not a function of religion itself and it is far better for atheism in both a structural and ideological sense to keep politicized religion out of the public sphere and a direct political attack on religion would force religious leaders into a political contest they are guaranteed to win as the overwhelming majority of voters are religious.'},\n",

However if it was even remotely true we would expect to see a lot more Christians committing acts of violence on nonChristians. But the worst weve gotten are very small groups screaming about homosexuals and picketing funerals. Its also worth noting that this notion of all contemporary Christians following the Bible utterly literally is complete nonsense as is the idea that Contemporary Christians all have a very similar organization. There are thousands of denominations of contemporary Christians and they all follow the Bible differently. And even the most hardcore literalists I know of dont follow the Bible from an entirely literal standpoint.These people are a statistical minority a very fractional minority. To make a judgement call on a billion people of wildly varying practises and beliefs because of the actions of a tiny tiny fractional percent is simply ludicrous. Replace religion with ideology of any kind or maybe even human. There have been dangerous fundamentalists for all sorts of things even atheism. Communist states encouraged the rationality of atheism over religion which it was as an opiate to the masses but took this view so far that it brutally persecuted and murdered thousands of religious people over it. Actively cracking down on religion will feed it. When has banning anything ever made it LESS attractive? Our society in general loves taboo and to many religious there is little more noble than fighting the good fight and being persecuted for their faith. Utter nonsense. Youre talking about thought policing making it illegal to believe a certain thing. And since religion is such a broad topic unlike something specific like racism youre not even cracking down on a harmful belief. And of course you can say this with total certainty as opposed to the experts on the faith whove dedicated their lives to this sort of thing. Evident of course by the massive number of Christian fundamentals committing rampant human rights abuse all over. This is the absurdness of your argument you insist that Christian teachings encourage blatant human rights violation and that all true believers are compelled to act on such teachings. But there is scant in the way of evidence to remotely suggest such a thing. In the end your argument is complete garbage. You make outrageously bold claims you dont back up and suggest we should institute a thought police to control peoples beliefs. How exactly would you enforce the ban on religion anyway?

For example Im mixed wont say the exact mix to protect my anonymity but its a somewhat complicated mixture. Ive been mistaken for all sorts of things though typically people think Im latino or middle eastern Im neither. But you know how I identify myself if anyone asks? Third generation Canadian.Im going to go a bit further. Black is not a race. There are more races in Africa than in the rest of the world combined. Pygmies are very different from Bantu even though both are listed as black. Even describing Obamas father as Kenyan misses a lot. Was he Bantu or Nilotic or Cushitic? Something else? Black is a description because most people dont have much of a clue about the strong cultural and ethnic differences in parts of the world not their own.How do you refer to Indonesians? Do you distinguish between the Javanese and the Sundanese? They sure do. These people have been distinct for much longer than the existence of any one of these modern countries. To identify a man by his country is not to identify him by his race. There are no racially homogenous countries. My guess is that most people in North America would call them Asians but theyre all quite different from Chinese and Indians though there are many Indians in Indonesia. And even talking about Chinese or Indian is to lump together a range of ethnic groups more diverse than all of Europe. The differences between a Tamil and a Punjabi are gigantic. The Punjabi language is closer to English than to Tamil because Punjabi and English are IndoEuropean languages whereas Tamil is a completely different language group Dravidian.But in any case I think races are a total fiction. Like completely made up. The example I give is that Alice of race A marries Bob of race B and they have four kids Charlie Christina David and Delilah. Charlie and Christina marry persons of race A David and Delilah marry persons of race B and they all have kids. All of Charlie and Christinas descendants marry persons of race A all of David and Delilahs descendants marry persons of race B. So Alice and Bobs great grandkids great grandkids are each either race A or race B if I counted that right. But the descendants of Charlie are just as closely related to the descendants of Christina David and Delilah... even though Charlie and Christinas descendants are predominantly race A and David and Delilahs descendants are predominantly race B.Of course what happens after seven generations or so is that the definition of race changes. Seven generations takes something like two hundred years. The people of today are not very closely related to the people of two hundred years ago no matter who they are and who you are. No one of your ancestors from seven generations ago is related to you by more than one part in if you assume no inbreeding and eventually there is some.So my point is that race is a totally meaningless and fictitious label that doesnt help you to understand anything at all about a person. Those three people you listed even the one you retracted? Id use one label for them. American.'},\n",

The government determines where you live depending on where you work and how many people live with you and your rent is about cents. Then the food you need to buy rice mostly soap and the very basic stuff costs you mother to dollars per month. The rest is just for you to spend the way you want.The problem as Cubans put it is that for everything that is not basic necessity food hygiene and bus to your work basically the price is not subsidized. So even a shitty Tshirt made in indonesia will cost you dollars.... thats more than the half of what remains for you at the end of the month. Diapers for instance cost around a dollar per diaper. Some call diapers luxury but well... So how does that work ? well people who work with tourists get tips. Not the standard tip like in the US. just a few dollars but remember that when you give to your barmaid for a drink thats seventh of the money he has spare every month. So if a barman gets or tips a day that would be regular in a resort he can then share that money with his extended family. So one barman per family is necessary. Maids also get tips for around to a day so they can also help their families. All those people working in resorts also get a lot of presents from tourists diapers chothes shoes etc. that they give to their friends.Then the richest people are the local artists. Those guys are licensed by the government to sell paintings carvings jewels etc. to tourists. Of course controlling the money they actually make is impossible so they keep a lot for themselves. In Cuba at least last time I went there years ago the only people you see with a cell phone which costs the same as in the US are artists.However rich you get per month if youre a lucky barman or an artist you cant buy anything big. You cannot buy a house you cannot buy a car you have to have a government authorization to buy a recent car and you only get it if your work requires it. So you can basically afford... everything that does not show to much clothes diapers a restaurant with your family etc..

This is very prevalent in America from what Ive seen. People know very little about nuclear power but they know nuclear bombs almost ended the world.A big reason that were not switching to nuclear power is cost. Its very expensive to switch from the energy sources were using to nuclear power on a large scale.Another big reason is jobs. Many people depend on the oil industry and etc. for work. EDIT Check udavidschts post below! Its relevant and you should research economic impacts of technological shifts yourself too.

       "  'counters': 'The fundamental issue is that nuclear power has never been economically viable. Nuclear power companies have never been able to pay for the costs of their operations cradle to grave. The research the safety engineering construction the costs borne by neighbors insurance and especially the costs of disposing of nuclear waste have never been borne by the nuclear power industry. It has always been subsidized in some cases subsidized by states interested in the potential of nuclear power. There was some hope that eventually costs would decline and it would be viable on its own this has happened in the solar industry but no such luck.Remember thay even though there have only been major nuclear disasters there are only about nuclear power plants worldwide. That suggests the rate of failure of nuclear power plants is a bit lower than but that is misleading because many of those plants are relatively new I think about half built since Chernobyl so the true rate could be as high as .But even a rate is horrendous because as we have known since Chernobyl the consequences of a meltdown can be stupendously bad. The epidemiology of cancers associated with the Chernobyl fallout plume is heartbreaking. The area around it has been abandoned and returned to wilderness.The nuclear industrys argument was that that sort of think might happen in Russia or a thirdworld country but minus growing pains like Three Mile Island Western engineering and safety standards would keep us safe. Fukushima disproved that assertion no country has more technical and industrial expertise with nuclear than Japan and their safety standards failed to withstand extreme events.So here are the facts. Nuclear has never been any good purely as an economic proposition we pay tax money and other nonmonetary costs for the privilege of buying marketrate kW from nuclear companies. Nuclear power plants seem to be prone to disaster at unknown rates ? ? It is clear that meltdowns can be very bad Chernobyl could have been much worse. It is also clear that it cant happen here fails as an argument it could happen anywhere. Since nuclear power is a valuelosing proposition to begin with we pay subsidies for kW we could get at the same price from other forms of power there is no way to compare the value of nuclear power to estimates of the expected costs of future reactor meltdowns. Therefore there are strong reasons to retrench on nuclear power definitely in cases where the reactor hasnt been built yet possibly in cases where some of the sunk costs have already been lost.You say that nuclear power functions normally under the same conditions as other power plants but you seem to be neglecting that when a coal solar wind or hydro plant malfunctions you lose power but you dont have nuclear contamination endless cleanup costs and cancer to worry about.And to my friends with the downvotes maybe you would be more happy discussing nuclear energy on rpolitics ?'},\n",

This is a pic of same woman before and after breast augmentation surgeryTell me something if you looked like her before breast augmentation would you be more than happy with it or would you get breast augmentation surgery like her? Chances are at this stage you would be more than exhilarated if you had body like that and you wouldnt need breast implants.But the fact is that woman did. Somehow having a great body like that is still not sufficient. What male attention was she lacking BEFORE her boob job that she needed a breast implant? The same question is applicable for all those women who got breast implants. The fact is having a body like that on the left is still somehow not good enough.So what does that mean? Considering women with great looking bodies are getting boob jobs to look even better what are they missing there?Who are these men for whose standards are so high that women need fake tits to get them to be attracted to them?The fact is humans are nothing but animals with a rational ability. What is this rational ability? Its the ability we have with which we override our instinct and take a different route and achieve more desires than ever. A monkey sees a banana and if he is hungry he just wants to grab it and eat it. If a hungry you see a banana you wanna figure out if it doesnt belong to someone else and if it does then you try to resist your temptation and and this way are able to fulfill a lot more desires than the monkeyI mean you have an apartment you eat a lot more tasty foods than a monkey you watch movies you fly in the sky.Same goes with human courtship. As much as our biological desires want most men to be attracted to attractive female bodiesso much that women put fake tits and that still work on most men mankind moves along because attraction for it is still rational.I have no major attraction for the pics you posted because they are not that attractive. But I HAVE dated a woman with stomach like yoursit was stretch marks and weight loss plus some sort of surgery scar which I never asked about. I dont know anything about you so when you ask me to rate you thats precisely what you are going to hear.But does that mean you are never going to find someone who is attracted to you? Absolutely not a valid conclusion. Are you going to find someone who is PURELY physically attracted to you? Chances are slim but do you really want someone to be purely physically attracted to you?You know it within you that if you met someone who liked you purely for your physical body and genuinely found it attractivebut only that you still wont be happy in fact you would still be pretty unhappy. Because your rational mind recognizes the fact that that it wont last much long if thats the only thing there is to it.So the biggest question is thisand you seem to be asking this at other places in the thread Is it possible for a man to have sex with you and enjoy it based on physical appearance?The answer is definitely yes. But then how can I say it with such certainty?Consider it this way lets say you are in the mood of eating some fruits. You walk around the neighborhood and you see a giant sign which says Fresh Fruits juice! do you get water in your mouth and excitement in your mind. Is the feel the same as if fresh fruit itself were to serve to you? Its because your brainwhich has the rational capability understands that a sign which says fresh fruit juice implies fulfillment of the desire of fruits you have.On the other hand a monkey which desires a banana can only be excited by the sight and smell of a bananai.e. on a biological level without a rational ability we can only be excited about a real banana and not an indirect consumption of it. The smell and the sight of a real banana is just a way by which a primitive mind seeks food to satiate its hunger.Same goes with attraction. Yes I am a guy and I am attracted towards women based on their physical appearances. But at the end of the day its my brain which does the thinking and makes me act. Physical attraction is merely a more primitive way by which a man identified a partner who will give him the best offsprings but almost all people in the world marry based on the rational basis they marry and are attracted towards a person who would give them the most long term happiness.

Overall curriculum seems just to pass tests and get good grades rather than insight curiosity and help make people learners.this is where I think the internet comes in. So much information is available online today that high school seems obsolete. It is so easy to learn new things that actually interest you and explore the purpose of high school. Instead of being fed meaningless information that may or may not be relevant for your life on the internet you can dynamically learn whatever you want and in as much depth as you want.

Or maybe you have a very idiosyncratic learning style. But most high school students have a huge amount to learn and learn it best in a classroom setting.. Teachers need to provide lectures in person in a classroom setting because high school students are teenagers and even if they are excited and ambitious learners they need some structure to make sure they stay committed to their work.. Teachers need to provide inperson lectures because just as with college lectures or for that matter other kinds of tutoring or personal interactions like dates the teacherstudent bond makes the classroom more engaging for both sides.. Much more than adults teen students are likely to get confused and need to be able to ask the instructor questions regularly including in the middle of a lesson.. Evaluation and feedback are an important part of education and teachers can give much better feedback to a class of students taking the same curriculum from the same teacher.. Selfguided students may have better instincts about what interests them than what is important. For example how many year olds fully understand the beauty of integral calculus? There are many yearolds who are grateful that they did hundreds of algebra problems so that they could be good at calculus but very few yearolds who are preemptively grateful. This is especially important in math but generally true for all subjects.. Students use class time for seminarstyle discussions and group projects. They also benefit from each others questions study cooperatively outside of class and encourage each other by providing some light competition.. If you do not care about what you learned your teachers have failed you as surely as if you did not know it. Part of an education is learning the what part is learning the why. Its easy for kids to learn something maybe celebrities latest affairs maybe baseball statistics. Whats hard is to learn something lifechanging while also learning the difference between lifechanging and trivial.. A high school education is important for other reasons not directly relevant to pedagogy. I have addressed pedagogy since you are mainly interested in replacing classrooms with online lectures as best I can tell. But socializing and having friends is as important for most teens as recess is for little kids. The public high school experience is crucial to how America at least views its communities. High schools offer a critical mass of kids for exploring many extracurricular activities. I hope you find these suggestions useful. I dont think all high school classrooms are good or that any are perfect. But a competentlyrun classroom in a competentlyrun school has infinite advantages over lectures on the internet.'},\n",

The escalation at around sends chills down my spine every time.Music that requires Passive ListeningHeres the kind of music I think youre not enjoying. The stuff on the radio the familiar andor common. Metallica based on another comment is awesome driving music for some because you dont need to know the words to get pumped.You dont need to pay attention to it to enjoy it. Its music that can safely be used to seek abnegation the dulling of thought that in the extreme borders on meditation or even inexistence. This is background music. That doesnt mean its not awesome in its own right for many folks but it doesnt require attention and often serves to supplement it in some way. This song for example is my go to background music for showers because Ive associated it in the past with peace of mind and late night excursions into the locker room to have the place all to myself I went to a military school with communal showers so this was a rare treat. Its repetitive and in the shower I cant hear the words but the echoing piano and the dull rhythm of Shings voice soothed me and made me feel less alone tucked away in the steelshod bowels of a military institution.Anyway that last bit was personal but I hope Ive explained my view concisely. Theres plenty of overlap between both types of approaches to music in general so its not a restriction. Its merely an observation on how folks listen. Perhaps youre not a fan of music because youre not finding the way you might want to listen to it. I recommend looking for more songs that require active attention if youre really interested in changing your view. Here comes the Cheeeesiest ending Ive ver posted Otherwise...'},\n",

Rape is definitely one of the worst things that can happen to somebody but I think that survivor suggests that what happened to them was on the same level as living through a genocidal campaign a terminal illness a plane crash or something else of the sort. The former is bad but the latter are almost certainly worse. Rape victims calling themselves survivors takes attention away from more serious issues in which death is on the line.

My rapists intention was to take my life figuratively possibly literally. How do I know? He said so.

The buyerconsumer has all the power because he is the one who comes into the transaction with money. It is up to the sellerproducer to perform. The customer is always right. In labor transactions the buyerconsumer is the equivalent of the bossemployer.In ordinary forms of work the sellerproducer can ameliorate his or her powerlessness through achievement. Whether you are the inventor of the iPhone or you moped the floor you used your abilities to achieve something and created value. Accomplishment is one of the core meanings of life that provide fulfillment. In sex work however the focus of the end product is the body itself which is the embodiment of the workers existence and not the result of her achievement yes hard work such as diet and exercise go into shaping the body but they do not create the body. In summary Sex work is inherently sexed with men cast as buyers and women as sellers. Buyers inherently have the power over sellers in economic transactions. The thing being sold by the sex worker is not her achievement but her consent to use her body. Hence sex work is inherently unequal and privileges men while degrading women.',\n",

If its not inevitable couldnt the gendered division of buyers and sellers actually be the result of a lack of gender equality? Indeed the underlying reason for the current situation is pretty simple female sexuality is accorded value by society while male sexuality is not. That sexist doublestandard creates a situation where sex is generally conceptualized as something women give and something men get usually in return for something else. Naturally this lends itself to a situation where virtually all prostitutes are women because by and large women have sexual capital to sell and men dont.Because this all results from an underlying condition of gender inequality your argument is actually circular according to you prostitution cant coexist with gender equality because of its gender asymmetry yet that gender asymmetry only exists because of a lack of gender equality in the first place. In a theoretical situation with full gender equality the gender asymmetry your argument is based on could quite easily not exist.'},\n",

I thusly turned to boneout or boneless wings to satisfy my chicken based cravings which although satisfying often fell a bit short of the standard imposed by the bonein wing. What eventually compelled me to return to eating bonein wings was learning how to properly eat the wings themselves. An indian friend of mine laughed as he watched me try to eat wings we had ordered at a bar he taught me a method to removing the bone similar to this which negated a lot of the resentment I had harboured towards said wings.Now the main detraction from eating bonein wings becomes solely economical and I often find myself willing to spend a few extra dollars for an order of wings which I would deem of slightly higher appeal as graded by my threefold wing criteria.'},\n",

Its not its a very subpar piece of technology filled with proprietary requirements like their charger and iTunes. It should be seen as a brand name phone. Its a fashion accessory which you show off to people who dont know anything other than what advertising has forced down their throats. Its not wrong to go with iPhones but its wrong to defend the product as a superior piece of technology iPhone users say that new android phones are too big and then they get the plus and say its good theyre all over the place like politicians. I personally feel that the Android users you run into MIGHT be circlejerky at times but overall its users who are knowledgeable looking at people who are ignorant yet blissful and those knowledgeable users are being told by said ignorant users that their advanced technology is worse than the iPhone. Its not intentionally circlejerky if the Android users are right theyre not going out for upvotes or karma or whatever. Theyre trying to educate but they suck at educating I know I do.'},\n",

       "  'counters': 'The existence of motor vehicles makes this point mostly moot since regardless of differences in form theyre just sitting in a box which protects them fine. And those boxes are usually in bags cushioned by insulation if youre ordering delivery. Ill give you that theyre easier to transport over short distances on foot but this shouldnt really be a metric in determining which is the superior form of the food.I dont want or need my pizza to be so hot I cant bite into it. Part of the reason that I like pizza is because by the time I order it receive it and set it out on plates its the perfect temperature for me to dig into right away. Calzones are almost always too hot especially if ordering fresh which usually results in me having to use a fork to cut one open or poke holes in it to let it cool thereby ruining the integrity of the build you so admire or cutting off an end segment and awkwardly blowing into it for several minutes trying to avoid the steam.The crust will be pointing up at close to a degree angle on each side not enveloping the toppings around degrees its not the same thing.Youll find the same problem with calzones if you stuff them too full. Not unlike an overstuffed burrito. The ingredients will squeeze out of the sides or come bursting forth from the hole made by the first bite you take falling immediately onto the plate or your lap. The solution is to not overfill a calzone and to not overtop a pizza. This has more to do with the way individual restaurants are run. You dont have to provide slices at all most chains dont. What you consider waste may also be donations to the local homeless shelter or to hungry employees on their breaks or perhaps the last lucky customer of the day. Bakeries do it all the time with leftover bread. While it may result in slight financial losses these are negligible and its great for boosting morale and PR.Plus you run into the same issue with calzones too. You can serve them the same way you do slices and come up with leftovers when nobody orders the ones you made in anticipation or you can make to order as many establishments do with personal sized pizzas.Also this is just a personal preference but I enjoy the feeling of the cheese and toppings on the roof of my mouth. I hate biting into two sides of crust. Theres a reason so many people throw away the heel or butt of a loaf of bread when theyre done.'},\n",

       "  'counters': 'Calzones are more laborintensive and therefore more expensive. The labor scales linearly with the amount of food as opposed to pizza where only small additional efforts can greatly increase the size of the dish and therefore the available food. Pizza is stackable and therefore much more easy to deliver. When pizza is available to a group each person can decide how much they want to eat in units of a slice with calzone you pretty much have to eat a whole calzone so people who dont want that much food must either go hungry or waste food. This same argument assists those attempting to limit caloric intake.Pizzas are typically made with a tomatobased sauce giving them a distinctive flavor. Calzones are traditionally made with only a cheese stuffing and a sauce provided as a dip. This makes it logistically difficult in groups who has the dip? as well as more difficult to eat as well as making the delivery problem more difficult again.'},\n",

I believe this everexpanding trend of subreddits having more and more rules as to what can and cannot be posted has degraded the quality of reddit in general over the years. Ive been on reddit for a long time before there were subreddits longer under a different account. The discussion before subreddits started creating so many rules was so much more vibrant. The opinions were all over the board and this made the discussions that existed really enthralling to read. Now each subreddit has their own defined set of narrow rules and it requires you to be a subreddit expert to find a subreddit where the post you want to make doesnt break any rules. When you do find such a subreddit it is a dead one with to comments per submission and there is no discussion because it is a very narrow viewpoint subreddit. I believe overall content would be much more interesting to read if moderators of subreddits would remove or at least be more lax on the submission guideline rules. The specific post for use as an example in this discussion was an abortion article asking if it is time to rethink what weeks an abortion is allowed because doctors in the UK are saving babies at weeks and younger. My view could also be changed if someone were able to point out to me a subreddit where this kind of post could be made and that subreddit has actual traffic so that an active discussion would actually take place. I tried rnews but it doesnt allow opinions. I thought about rabortions but its mostly dead. I thought about rprochoice but its too onesided.

The only way to stop this from happening is to make bad things less profitable. Legislation is a great way to do this but like everything has its caveats. As long as it is profitable for companies to influence legislation against the good of the people it will be done. They will fight against others to keep it profitable and to make it more profitable.

We dont need to keep them happy we just need to keep them from leaving.

I dont feel bad about this and I kind of think most of these men are idiots and deserve it. The only way a man would lose HALF of his stuff a debatable term I agree but Ill continue to use it here for simplicity is if the man is earning of the income in a marriage and the woman is earning . A marriage is a business partnership that is ... so I cant help but think that men who marry unemployed and unemployable woman are idiots. Its comparable to starting a business with my highschool buddy who is broke and has nothing to actually invest in the business... youd have to be stupid to start a financialbusiness partnership in such circumstances. If Im going to start a business with someone Id expect they contribute half or at least close to half eg or more at the very least... otherwise they have very little nothing to lose and I have more to lose than my fair share.Women make about of what men make no? Correct me if Im wrong. So it shouldnt be too hard to find a potential wife that is at least in the same income bracketrange as the man correct? A man who marries a woman so far outside his income bracket is comparable to a man who invests and starts a business with a homeless bum and expects to share the losses if things go south. Why are men marrying women in what seems like large numbers based on the abovelinked post who have little to no earning ability? Why are they starting business partnerships with them? Why is it so hard to find a wife that has a job? Is the jobless rate for women that high? Or are unemployed and uneducated women simply more attractive? Are employed women not considered marriage material? WTF is going on?I guess in short I think people should marry others who earn similar to themselves and if they do otherwise are knowingly and consentually doing so with the understanding that they are carrying mostall of the financial risk. They shouldnt have a right to complain that they got finacially screwed when they consentually chose to be the only one to make a financial investment in their marriage.Can someone help me see their side of the story because I genuinely dont see it and dont get it.

Its more okay for them to be upset about losing stuff though so thats what they complain about.I dont think its necessary to go to extremes like some of the responses here have to feel sympathy for men who have gone through a divorce. Maybe they were very happy to marry a woman who makes less than them or to have a spouse that quits working to look after their children. They didnt really think about the stuff aspect of marriage when things were good. Then something happens and maybe its noones fault but the marriage breaks up. They have all the same feelings of hurt and disappointment but dont necessarily have the language to express it. They look at their married life and see time spent at work and think I spent all that time earning money and now I dont even have that. It takes a pretty big person to look at a failed relationship and say Well we just werent compatible so I can understand wanting to get sympathy and maybe bash your ex to strangers.

However Im starting to get worried because of all these people who arent being able to handle their sex lives after marriage.A personal request to everyone who replies I used to have the opinion that its completely fine to wait until marriage to have sex but these real life empirical examples all around me is the thing that is most discouraging to me.So if you can please try to speak from personal experience because knowing that Im hearing a true story about a real person will be more assuring to me than a very well educated opinion at this point.Please be patient and understanding with me. I really want to believe otherwise which is why I am asking all of you for help.',\n",
       "  'counters': 'It is worth distinguishing between three things a Only having one sexual partner during your lifetime b waiting to become sexually active with your partner in whole or in part until after marriage or some other form of commitment and c rushing into marriage in order to become sexually active with your partner. Of these three only C seems potentially dangerous to me although of course people who are culturally pressured into A and B are more likely to stumble into C.Now if A one lifepartner is fine without C then B must be pretty harmless without C as well... if you do all your sexual experimentation with one partner you are going to end up in pretty much the same place eventually whether you start in the back seat of your parents car or the bridal suite.Note that teenagers are immensely insecure about their romantic prowess and sexual relationships. You will almost never as a teenager her a friend talking publically about how awful their sex life is but if you go to rsex or rrelationships you can find hundreds of anonymous youngsters sometimes on their third or fourth relationship baring their souls and asking if sex ever gets better. Your adult married friends may be frank about their sex problems because they are confident and happy and dont mind dishing out TMIstyle status updates in their journey from awkward virgins to sex deities.Anyway there is not much statistical information about type B and type C but if you go to specifically pages you can see information of spread of sexual partners. Note two things. First people with bachelors degrees are most like to have only lifetime sexual partner and are also skewed into lower numbers in the other categories. We associate college with sluts and sex but college grads who presumably make the best decisions and statistically have the lowest rates of divorce are more likely to have a single partner. Second look at the breakdown by decade. If firstpartner relationships were sexually doomed you would expect to see twentysomethings with only one lifetime partner leave their sexual failure of a marriage and move into the or partner category. But that doesnt happen the percentage of people in the onepartner category in their twenties thirties and forties is remarkably similar suggesting that these relationships are durable and thus at least relatively happy. So overall while I personally wouldnt pressure anyone to stay sexually inactive until marriage your fears arent supported by statistics.'},\n",

Courts award fundamental rights among them the right to marry along specified criteria one of them being immutable characteristics. Facing discriminatory treatment due to race gender or immutable sexuality is impermissible. If courts believed that sexuality is a choice they would be less likely to rule in favor of samesex marriage since the person in question could get married to someone she loves if she only chooses hard enough. However claiming that sexuality is an immutable unchangeable inherent characteristic puts the issue in a new light. The argument is now that the laws are refusing someone equal treatment and benefits on the basis of a characteristic this individual cannot change.Of course whether someone chooses to be gay or is born gay shouldnt matter in how we treat them in daytoday life. Courts require a higher bar to grant legal privileges and arguing that this characteristic is immutable is the best way to secure those rights.'},\n",

Are you really immune as a U.S. citizen? How many innocent people are falsely labeled or punished? And who gets to decide? The problem with the war on terror is there will never be an end.

Perfect for growing the military industrial complex adding to the increase of mass surveillance police militarization drone strikes and innocents being accused imprisoned or killed. It is a true modern day witchhunt. There will always be a terrorist because terrorism is an ideology. But as the years go by the word is being more and more loosely defined.

We are probably even considered a terrorist to our terrorists.

They didnt attack strategic targets they tried to terrorize the US into meeting their demands. The same is true of say the IRA bombings in London the Boston Marathon bombing and pretty much any suicide bomber who goes into civilian areas with the intent of killing as many people as possible.Well yeah you need to target nonstrategic targets in a way to incite mayhem and fear to accomplish a political goal. So if you are just insane and think its fun to kill people you arent a terrorist just a murderer without a political agenda. If you try to blow up a military base you arent a terrorist youre a guerrilla fighter.. No. The Oklahoma City bombers were terrorists. So was the Unabomber.The pursuit of potential terrorists is a different question. But most people decide that those who attempt to use violent acts to cause fear to achieve political goals are by definition terrorists.Its shorthand for preventing terrorist acts and easier than saying The war on Al Queda Al Shabab the KKK Hamas and every other group that wants to commit terrorist acts.Yes in the same way that the war on crime or the war on poverty will never be won. But just because you cant declare victory doesnt mean you shouldnt fight it.No a witch hunt implies that youre searching for imaginary enemies. Thats simply not true. There are real live people out there who want to blow up Americans the more the better. There are Americans leaving to fight in the middle east who may come back and use what theyve learned. This isnt just some bogus red scare stuff there are people who want you dead simply for being an American.And Terrorism isnt an ideology its a tool.

If this breaks I can use any stock part to replace whatever might break.

People often use it as a way of identifying membership or belonging to a subset of the population in your example latino. A sort of linguistic shorthand for Im in the group. You Im assuming are not Latino and therefore having someone flash their metaphorical membership card when speaking with you leaves you with a subtle left out of the group feeling. Of course this happens in all sorts of settings and isnt necessarily related to nationalityethnicity.

Similarly people who are avid fans of the TV show Family Guy may jokingly mispronounce words that begin wh to sound like hw if youre not familiar with this meme search youtube for family guy cool whip.

       "  'counters': 'Im not a native English speaker but I speak English better than my native tongue Portuguese. Still I feel awkward as all hell when I speak Portuguese words usually names in English. The normal American accent I have seems wrong and switching languages altogether seems even wronger.That said I feel like some words should be spoken with a normal American accent and some should be spoken with their original languages phonemes. Spanish words like Latina should definitely be in American. Its an English word now borrowed from Spanish. On the other hand French words and phrases like raison dtre are not loanwords but actual French words and should be pronounced in French perhaps not with an exaggerated Parisian accent but with the right French phonemes emulated in English perhaps with the American R rather than the French R but still with the French vowels.It seems that the distinction is between languages but its really between whether a word is a foreign word or a borrowed word. When I order a tatsutaage I say it with Japanese pronunciation. When I order sushi I say it with American pronunciation. The tatsutaage set at my local nicer Japanese restaurant comes with better side dishes. I dont think thats relevant but it is delicious.This extends to geographic names as well. You say Japan with an American accent you dont say Nippon like in actual Japanese. Thats because Japan is not actually a Japanese word! On the other hand place names without American pronunciations should be pronounced somewhat close to the original but not exaggeratedly so. I tell people I was born in Reeyow dee Djuhnehrow but it drives me crazy when my fathers birthplace is pronounced Sahw Pawlow. Its Suhoong Pahwlow. You gotta get that right! And it drives me even crazier when people pronounce Brazil with an emphasized S and L because in Portuguese its actually pronounced Braziu.Basically pronounce loanwords normally in English and for foreign words approximate them as well as you can in English without slipping into a foreign accent.'},\n",

       "  'titles': 'The Fender Stratocaster is superior to the Gibson Les Paul',\n",
       "  'arguments': 'Both are iconic fantastic guitars. The Stratocaster has been played by greats such as Jimi Hendrix and Eric Clapton. The Les Paul has been the mainstay of other great guitarists such as Slash and Zakk Wylde. By reputation alone either guitar would appear to be vitally important throughout the history of all forms of rock music. However I believe that the Stratocaster has a few important areas where it is superior. The Stratocaster is much more common in other genres of music than the Les Paul is. Great Blues artists like Buddy Guy Robert Cray and Stevie Ray Vaughan all are known for playing Stratocasters. While country music is more known for the Stratocasters sibling the Telecaster you will see country artists like Vince Gill play a Stratocaster from time to time.A good guitarist can get a wide range of sounds out of either the Les Paul or the Stratocaster but I believe the Stratocaster can offer more. Les Paul type guitars are equipped with dual coil humbucker pickups which combined with the weight and materials of the guitar are the reason for their iconic deep resonating sound. To make them more versatile most modern Les Pauls are equipped with coil tapping or coil splitting. The result is that you can make the pickups act more like a single coil. This eliminates the humbucking sort of a form of noise cancellation and sounds more stratlike. However it is still very far from the iconic honk you can get with a single coil Fender pickup. Most Stratocasters come in the SSS configuration which is three single coil pickups. If you turn up the volume on the guitar all the way and place the pickup selector to position it uses the middle and neck pickup together and sounds more similar to the sound you would get with a humbuckerequipped guitar than the humbuckerequipped guitars can sound like single coil. If that is not sufficient and you vastly prefer the sound of humbuckers Fender makes HSH and other pickup layouts to give you humbuckers. Ive never tried these so I cant really comment on them.Another feature that I feel is superior in the Stratocaster is the shape of the components of the guitar. The flat fretboard on the Les Paul has the strings a little too close together for my taste in comparison to the more roomy Stratocaster. Also the thinner neck makes it easier for me to wrap my thumb around if I were trying to play some chords similarly to how Jimi Hendrix would play them. The cutaway design of the body is much easier to deal with on the Stratocaster and allows easier access to the higher frets. The bridge is another factor for me since the bridge on the Les Paul sticks out further while the bridge on the Stratocaster is much lower making it easier to move your hand around while sticking close to the body of the guitar. That being said I will give some points to the Les Paul for the angled head being superior as well as the tuners being better on most Les Pauls that Ive played. That doesnt negate the other concerns though.To summarize I own and play both a Stratocaster and a Les Paul. My next guitar will probably be a PRS Custom because I feel like it provides a really good middle ground and has its own unique improvements over each. I love both guitars but I like my Stratocaster a little bit more. Change my view and explain to me how the Gibson Les Paul is a superior guitar.',\n",
       "  'counters': 'So most of your argument is listing things the strat can do that a typical Les Paul cant. But you need to also take into account the things a Les Paul can do that a stratocaster cant Since a les paul has a volume control for each pickup not like a volume master control like the strat you can set one pickup volume to zero and then use the pickup selector as a kill switch. This is very useful if you are going for that robotictrippy effect used by many bands like RATM or NIN. Similar to above you can set the volume to one pickup to be very loud and the other to be softer. So if you are playing a song where you switch from playing softer rhythm tones to more distorted lead tones you can already have this set so all you have to do is switch pickups without using any peadl or adjusting your amp. A strat you would you need to use the switch AND turn the volume control to taste. The shorter scale of the Les paul makes string bending much easier for people without a lot of finger strength. Some people with smaller fingers prefer this shorter scale and smaller string spacing because it makes chords which require long finger stretching easier. For example a Gsus on the lowest three strings like this xxx You pointed out the Strat is better for playing with the thumb on the low E but as someone who uses that technique on both strats and les pauls it depends entirely on the neck. There are Les pauls with thick necks sure but you may not know that the neck shape they were using in the s was about as thin as the strat neck shape. So it just depends what periodspecs the les paul is. You pointed out that people like the cutaway bodies of the strat but keep in mind a lot of players dont like running into the neck heel when they try to slide to the upper frets. Strats have a noticable square shape where the neck meets the body in back where as a Les paul has a curve leading into the neck heel which makes it more comfortable for some people.I also wanted to point out this is objectively not true. Position of a strat actually reduces midrange frequencies and humbuckers are known for having more mids. It will take out the hum if the strat middle pickup is set up for reverse polarity but the sonic signature of the frequencies is actually about as far from a humbucker as you can get.'},\n",

       "  'arguments': 'Ive been bothered by all of the discussions about rape for a long time and I think Ive finally figured out whyRape is the only crime Im aware of where you can accuse someone and potentially even get them punished without real evidence.If I accused someone of robbing me the first that would be demanded is evidence. Without any evidence nobody would take my accusation seriously.But because so often theres no evidence in a rape case its become acceptable for evidenceless accusations to be taken seriously. Simply being accused of rape can get people fired from their jobs and destroy their life.Heres a great example of this where a student is carrying around a mattress until their accused rapist is expelled At that point what their doing has nothing to do with the legal system theyre just shaming the entire system until someone gives into their demands. Thats not how it works. If theres not enough evidence to accuse someone of the crime if the court turns it down then you cant convict them. Period.Its not the court being blind to rape victims its that its better to let guilty people escape than to let one innocent suffer an established part of our legal system.In the end I wholeheartedly agree that rape is a horrible thing that we need to find a solution to. I just dont think that the solution lies in making it acceptable to accuse people without evidence rape or otherwise.',\n",
       "  'counters': 'Okay lets explain whats actually going on here.In criminal courts the prosecution has to prove someones guilt beyond a reasonable doubt which as you have pointed out is really difficult to prove in cases of date rape. Its so difficult that the police and DAs are reluctant to take on those cases in fear that theyll be seen as incompetent because they will lose those cases.Because the legal system is unhelpful and sexual assault is a pretty big problem in universities they created these disciplinary committees where the burden of proof is the preponderance of the evidence more likely than unlikely instead of beyond a reasonable doubt just like a civil case.Now the reason the burden of proof is lower is because the consequences are smaller. The most a school disciplinary board can do is expel a student. They cant put anyone in jail or fine them. This is something all students agree to when they sign the admission papers.Now before you say this is still unfair the guy she accused of raping her was accused by two other women and all three times he wasnt punished so it isnt like men are being accused and expelled all willy nilly. You still need to prove it beyond a he said she said situation.'},\n",

Giving up at is in my opinion a bit premature. . We all die eventually and everything in between is pointless. You could reduce anything to being pointless with a cynical attitude. Hell the universe is pointless and stupid from that kind of POV. But more than that Im guessing your depression is saying that not you. Im curious have you ever pondered why other people care? Like why other people who acknowledge that their lives are a blip on the cosmic timeline if even that keep going on in life? Or what makes someone that is desperately clinging to life feel that way versus you who are contemplating tossing yours away. I think thats fascinating in and of itself in my opinion. I really think your feelings on it are just a matter of perspective. Perhaps you can do your own research ask your parentsgirlfriendfriends if they understand their year lifespan is a microscopic speck on the cosmic timeline much less the Earths and why that doesnt send them into crippling doubt and apathy. Its not to say youll suddenly be happy or motivated to keep living but itll probably be a good chance to gain some perspective.. Piggy backing off of a bit you need to determine if its really you that feels this way or if its depression. In other words do you make the best decisions when drunk or impaired? I dont really see dealing with a mental illness as all that different. Ive been through severe depression. I spent a good chunk of my early s in the grip of something I really couldnt deal with all that well. I went to a therapist I got medication and eventually sorted it all out. However I wont lie and say I never thought about suicide. I wont lie and say that I dont catch myself years later still pondering some of the darkmacabrebleak things I did when I was depressed. But the thing is now I have the perspective to look at the situation more clearly. Yeah my life meant nothing before I was born and yeah when my life fades from collective memory itll mean nothing then too but that doesnt make me question if its worth living anymore now that Im not depressed. And yeah if you cant be bothered to try or feel that you cant be bothered to try because it sucks right now for you I get it. I really do. But you have the choice. You have the luxury to spend a little more time figuring it out because youll have all of the rest of eternity to be dead. All in all I think the biggest mistake you could make is at this crucial junction in your life determine to live for reasons that arent your own. You dont want to be sitting there years later regretting things because you did them for the wrong reasons. Now I realize this might not sound like encouragement to keep living but it really is finding a reason to live that you can live with later is extremely important so you dont end up depressed years later asking the same questions you are now. I think life is worth living simply because we are here. That is I have my own dreams goals desires etc. But like I said before I have all of eternity to be dead I dont find that to be a reason to hasten that end.'},\n",

       "  'arguments': 'When talking about Depression people often say things like some people think people with Depression are just lazy but in fact its their brain chemistry making them behave that way. Okay certainly it is the case that folks with Depression have brain chemistry that causes their behavior. However that is also true of literally everyone else. There is no magical you that is distinct from your brain chemistry you are exactly the chemicals that make up your body no more and no less. The Depression is a part of you just like a broken or nonbroken leg is a part of you. Similarly so is Laziness.Lazy people have brains that incline towards being lazy just like Depressed people have brains that incline towards being depressed. It makes no sense to me to consider Depression to be a totally forgiveable medical condition that the sufferers of it cannot be blamed for their behavior but not do the same with Laziness.

So... whats the advantage of calling one of these things a disease vs. a character flaw? What needs to be done to treat it. Depression can be easily treated with medication. Theres absolutely no need to impose any kind of psychological incentives on the person in order to treat them and indeed those incentives are generally counterproductive.However there is no medical cure for laziness come on really meth? Get real. Thats not a cure its another disease... and someone on meth might be more active but they wont accomplish any more of what we want people to accomplish.. However laziness can be impacted by the incentives that we give to a person. Peer pressure is effective on laziness. Economic incentives are effective on laziness. Calling it a character flaw is effective in changing peoples level of laziness. Almost all that we do with moral systems are tricks to deal with things that we dont have other good ways to deal with in order to gain advantages for society. It absolutely makes sense to consider laziness a character flaw but not depression. The former is effective in disincentivizing laziness and causing change in the person in a way that nothing else is. Calling depression a character flaw to the contrary is not only ineffective it is actively counterproductive and will result only in more depression.'},\n",

In short well be able ensure he gets all the resources hell ever need.If we have more than one those previously mentioned resources will be stretched more thinly. Dont get me wrong we wont go hungry if we have two children but we wont be able to fully fund two educations and still live the life we would have been able to with one child.Money and lifestyle aside were very thankful that hes the picture of health. What if we have a second and she isnt as healthy? Why ruin what you already know is a good thing?I guess I just do not see the value in having a second child. In my eyes less is more.',\n",

As a college educated guy thats k in debt used to be and has sisters and a poor family I have never once caught myself thinking damn if only my sisters hadnt been born I could be debt free or if my sisters werent around I could have eaten more steak as a kid and less pbampj or if only I didnt have sisters then I could have afforded more nice things. Fancy meals come and go expensive electronics break or become obsolete with the passage of time college is important but not worth giving up a sibling for family though and the impression they leave on you lasts forever and is important in shaping the adult that a kid will grow up to be. Youd be depriving your one child of a special bond theyll never be able to replicate with anyone else by not having another kid.The point about sickness isnt really a point.

Those are normal natural and very healthy things to do! Even exercise that normally includes sweat and its messy and you get tired and your muscles ache shouldnt this be a horrible activity?

       "  'counters': 'Dayam man I feel sorry for you. As you said you grew up where it was taboo being told over and over that your body is dirty and that doing it is wrong... You are conditioned to that response that is why it happens. Unfortunately it is likely too hard to decondition you to this response especially with nothing but a logical argument so I dont think this will do you any good.. but... I will try. I suppose the best place to start is by trying to normalize masturbation for you if you have been taught it is wrong then perhaps you think that you are wrong to be doing it. In what is likely the most risky search I have entered into my google search all day I typed Masturbation in Animals into my search engine which pointed me to this nice and much more safe wiki link . While I already knew that animals did masturbate before searching the link I figure you would rather read it for yourself. Basically though the idea is that masturbation is observed in multiple species not just humans. This means that it is a natural thing for us to do natural being by definition as existing in or derived from nature not made or caused by humankind.. So essentially being raised to see it as a failing as a fault as something which makes you have a problem is actually what is unnatural here. Animals do it for the same reason we do it feels good but there are also other more scientific reasons as to why masturbation can be good for us.Firstly the obvious it helps you sleep reduces stress and all sorts of stuff which is beneficial for coping with day to day life. Ironically in most people masturbation causes an increase in self esteem since it lets you relive your sexual tension in a safe and controlled way kinda the opposite to you. In what is likely the single greatest headline ever to grace the BBC Masturbation cuts cancer risk While it is true ejaculation is what is really cleaning up the pipes so to speak this provides a way for people not in a relationship to enjoy the benefits. Which is why sometimes I joke to people about doing my part to help fight prostate cancer when talking about fapping. Also the fact is that if masturbation did cause these bad things to happen in YOUR life then they would do the same in everyones life. The thing is masturbation and fapping isnt your problem it is the guilt and shame you feel which makes you feel the whole world is against you. Imagine you were meeting up with someone for a date you didnt hit it off so it turned sour and you went home alone ironically I am sure that would be the perfect time to masturbate but this isnt the point of this example. But lets have a look at what caused that. Before your date you were told by a crazy friend that you shouldnt be dating a Libra because they are Indecisive flirtatious and downright deceptive your Libra will tell you what you want to hear. Problem is theyll be telling everyone what they want to hear. stolen without guilt from a random forum since I dont believe in or understand that astrology shit. You go to that date dismissing what your friend said but during the night you notice little things that remind you of his words. Because of this you obsess over them act differently then you otherwise would and cause the night to end in ruin without even realizing it. Meanwhile if you went on the date without hearing this you would have just accepted that things were going great without a second thought. Maybe either way the date would have ended badly maybe it wouldnt but being told or not being told would be a defining factor Look man I know it is hard to overcome indoctrination overcome the feeling that your body is dirty Hell. If you have a fetish for something you dislike it works the same way. Even if you know logically it doesnt matter you cant help it and that it really doesnt do you any harm it still makes you feel dirty once you finish. The trick is learning to accept yourself and your body for how it is and to try and not focus on blaming and shaming yourself since you dont deserve that. Good luck'},\n",

       "  'counters': 'There was once a guy called B.F. Skinner who experimented on pigeons. He fed them at regular intervals using an automated feeding system. What he found was over time the birds had begun to think that the certain movements they made in their cages were responsible for the food being produced. In reality there was no physical relationship between their actions and the production of the food but they had nonetheless come to believe there was a causal relationship and so they would perform the actions whenever they were near feeding time in order to make the food come.This is a form of cognitive bias and it is found in humans as well as pigeons. In fact it is the basis of all superstition. Our brains are very good at finding patterns in things and unfortunately this often leads to them desperately trying to find a link between two events where there is none. When something doesnt fit the mental conception we have about something we dont remember it. But when it does fit we remember it. You know how sometimes it feels like you can receive a call on your phone just by thinking about it? Like youre thinking about someone ringing you and then it happens? It feels like you have some sort of power. In fact whats happening is that you simply dont remember the thousands of times that you think of your phone and dont get a call because they do not fit the more attractive mental model you have the idea that you can control your phone with your mind.So because of your upbringing which has led to your irrational guilt over an act which is completely normal healthy and nothing to be remotely guilty over your mind desperately tries to reach out and look for patterns. You are not only forgetting the times when you masturbate and nothing negative happens but youre also completely ignoring anything positive because you do not believe there to be a connection. In reality there is no connection between either the negative or the positive.Heres what you do every time you masturbate write down on your computer a list of everything positive AND negative that occurs over hours. Be as fair as you possibly can. Do not just try and remember without writing anything down because then you will fall victim to the bias you will only remember the negative and forget the positive. Write down both positive and negative straight away. Then have a control section where you pick a random time of the day when you havent masturbated and you write down everything positive and negative that came in the hours after that. If you do this without skewing the results over a period of time you should find there is absolutely no correlation between selfstimulation and unrelated events of your daily life. And why on earth would there be?'},\n",

       "  'counters': 'The best hyperrealist artists aim to offer something that is better and more perfect than what a straight photograph can offer. Many of them even mix references to create scenes that literally do not exist and cannot therefore be photographed. Although they use photographic references they rely on their own experience in painting or drawing from life in order to enhance the photorealistic experience of a subject.For instance there is a pretty big difference between this drawing made with six different colors of Bic ballpoint pens and the original reference image Overlaid in Photoshop you can see that the artist made some changes to the facial structure of the model took great artistic license with the colors in the original photograph and used various techniques to simplify unimportant details. This particular piece isnt truly hyperrealistic due to the limitations inherent to using only six colors of Bic ballpoint pen but it is extremely realistic. But you couldnt take that photograph as it is depicted in this piece because that girl doesnt exist. She has been altered to suit the artists vision.Unfortunately not too many truly good hypperealists will show references on their artist pages so its not easy for people to see how the artist transforms the source material.In any event for artists much of the work is about the process. You can take a decent portrait in about an hour or two including lighting makeup and other setup details. A person who spends hours painting or drawing pores freckles the galaxy of colors and shapes in a persons iris etc. has many more opportunities to make the piece more personal emotional and become more intimate with their subject matter. Not on a personal level necessarily but from the standpoint of really seeing something. The experience of such intense study can enhance nonphotorealistichyperrealistic endeavors too. So its not necessarily pointless or stupid or an exercise in egostroking.'},\n",

       "  'counters': 'In my mind the crowd that justifies the viewing of the recent leaked photos is the same crowd that does not worry or care about photos of women posted without their consent. I think the comparison between these two things is fair but where we differ is that I dont believe weve decided as a society that we dont care about photos posted without consent celeb or no.As with many issues society as a whole tends to notice whats going on when it pertains to the famous. This is an unfortunate consequence of how we are wired and while it would be ideal to tone down the rather destructive celebrity worship culture weve built its an entirely different beast. When I read about these leaks I see the greater society becoming aware of an issue that has existed for quite some time in the peripheral. This happens all the time Michael J. Fox with Parkinsons Mel Gibsons racist tirades even celebrities engaging in the ALS challenge. When famous people bring an issue to light its not coming out of nowhere it already existed and now were paying attention.But anyway to your main point. I really want to say this without sounding preachy but the reason that viewing the recent leaked photos is invasion of privacy has more to do with the overall effect than the individual. What I mean is there may be nothing lawfully wrong with what youre doing but youre encouraging the act of leaking these types of things. On the internet pageviews matter. It reinforces the concept of internet infamy and rewards the behavior indirectly. You personally viewing the photos is a drop in the ocean. In the same vein you personally dropping a candy wrapper on the ground is an infinitesimally small contribution to pollution but you know that you are still contributing. Combine this with the knowledge that the release of the photos was done without permission and I think you have a compelling reason not to partake in the viewing. It may not be invasion of privacy in the same way that the person who leaked the photos did so directly but it is an indirect invasion of privacy in its encouragement and reward of those leaks. Cumulatively the damage is magnified.'},\n",

       "  'arguments': 'People that take a stand against same sex marriage typically will use any number of irrational and illogical arguments. One of the most common is that gay marriage somehow cheapens their marriage or that marriage is between defined as being between a man and a woman. Ignoring the glaring flaw that marriage is specifically not defined as between a man and a woman in America people should be looking at this stance as religious intolerance. first off their are christian churches that are willing to marry Gay people. So right off the bat to take this stand against gay marriage is being intolerant against certain forms of christianity. Many Buddhist sects are also accepting of gay marriage. So when you look at the fact that multiple different religions have opposing views how could you possibly come to any conclusion other than the fact that you are being intolerant of other religious traditions? The part of my title that mentions civil unions is a response to another common argument by anti gay marriage advocates which is that they just dont think it should be called marriage between same sex partners. This still falls under the category of being intolerant because you are trying to dictate what their religious beliefs label their union but it brings up another concern. If you think that marriage is a religious term why do you think the government should be issuing marriage certificates to anybody when we are supposed to have a separation of church and state in this country? Shouldnt it be the same as most of the rest of the world where you can get a government union and then have a religious ceremony separately?

This extends usually even to civil unions which are not guaranteed all of the same protections benefits and privileges. Part of the debate is that homosexual marriages should be treated exactly as heterosexual marriages. The position that no marriage should be legally recognized accommodates this. The other part of the debate is what protections benefits and privileges should be extended to married couples.Marriage even as a legally unrecognized institution incentivizes itself. As a married person you are engage in lifes challenges with a partner to help you through them. You have someone you are committed to love and someone who is committed to love you. With that alone its a pretty good deal.But there is your question of why would it be okay to create a law that specifically creates inequality? Any marriage law clearly does just this. It creates a special legal class for those who are married. Specifically it creates a special legal class of people who are given extra privileges protections and benefits. So people who already have the benefit of having someone love them enough to marry them are given extra privileges protections and benefits over those unlucky enough to find no such person. Nothing could be more clearly inequal.Take with this too some of the numbers going with this. In the US approximately of the population are homosexual while around of the population will never marry. Given that also probably of that that are homosexual will never marry either you really think there can be no secular way to disagree with giving extra legal privileges protections and benefits only to those lucky enough to find someone who loves them enough to marry them at the expense of those who do not?'},\n",

While they might currently be associated with douchebag bros this is an unnecessary association which will disappear over time and as such will not be accepted as an argument against their use.Sweatyclammy hands Some people are unfortunately genetically disposed to sweat more than others and having sweaty hands makes a handshake an unpleasant encounter for both the sweaty handed person who feels shame and the recipient who was expecting a dry hand. Fistbumps only result in contact with the tops of the fingers which tend to be dry for all people except perhaps some freaks.Germ exposure The palm of the hand is used for many daily activities such as scratching ones balls holding onto filthy handrails and squishing flies in a clap. Despite frequent hand washing icky bacteria is inevitably going to end up on your hands at several points during the day. The top of your hand however is rarely used and is therefore mostly free of germs and microbes that might want to transmit a cold or ebola.Speed and efficiency. A fistbump establishes a sense of camaraderie and kinship in just a second whereas a handshake can take several seconds to complete at a greater personal investment to both parties. In a working environment where you might have to greet many people each morning a fistbump saves time which could be spent working on important projects while still convincing your colleagues that you are happy to see them. As a side note a fistbump can be easily followed by a hug if more intimacy is required in the greeting or can be followed up by a quick sideways high five. Making a fizzling or dissolving fistbump is not in my opinion acceptable and will not be accepted in any counter arguments.',\n",

Everyone knows that lighting a fire under most people would get them to strive for more but not all will and many will fail to succeed. I believe some will commit suicide turn to prostitution rob steal riot etc. EconomyAssuming every former welfare recipient finds employment the job market would become oversaturate. This get a job you slacker! mentality is simply unrealistic. Special programs and regulations would have to be in place to hire a certain percentage of unskilled worker instead of qualified workers. I have heard the current state of welfare compared to slavery but welfare is free money to the recipient slavery more equates to working for minimum wage with no feasible escapement. Even with minimum wage there is a chance possibly small that one can work their way up or transition to a better job. As a rightleaning individual I think capitalism is a good thing. It is far from perfect but I believe it gives many people a chance. Welfare doesnt really give anything but sustenance. Welfare can be viewed as a result of capitalism. Not everyone wants to or is able to play the capitalists game. They currently get our scraps. The problem is we are getting stingy with our scraps.The new LawsNow laws have been passed requiring welfare recipients to pass drug tests to continue receiving aid. I think this is a bad idea for many reasons including costs. However the primary reason for me to not want to sneakily dismantle welfare is because the aid is intended to help children. No one gives a shit about the parents and for good reason fuck em. We are trying a trickle down approach to feeding children and single mothers.

Without ANYTHING physically changing but the state of your mind. Like a perfect ice cream Sunday or the last best wave on memorial day these things dont have to be infinite to have significance. Nothing is permanent. Yet we exist. SO GO ON with your soap operas. Enjoy the salt on each amp every chip. It doesnt have to have a point. The point is an arbitrary construct. A human illusion. You sitting here with a soap opera amp an internet connection is a whole galaxy of things to be perceived amp loved amp enjoyed. You want an opus or a tombstone? It wont last forever either. But theres a whole world of living in the things creation you get to go through first. Even the brief momentary absence of pain is wonderful no matter how hard or painful life is that moment when you lapse off to sleep is infinitely literally infinitely better than not having life.'},\n",

Only recently with the advent of suprareligious states brought about by the French Revolution has it been made into a secular issue.It wasnt something that people only started doing after someone voted for a law to bureaucratize it but the other way round it was something that was good and only then did states decide to appropriate it for their own sake.The state doesnt regulate marriage because its good for people.

Marriage has actually meant various things in different times. I assume you are religious and even the bible endorses several forms of marriage. The idea of a single man and woman as a married couple was never universal.Everyone below makes good points about what marriage means legally so I wont address it. I am going to use an example from my own country South Africa. Here it is legal for men of certain cultures to marry multiple wives. Culture is a sensitive thing here but government has kind of been forced to get involved in order to protect the rights of the women in these marriages since the existing laws dont cover this type of marriage and there has been lots of abuse as a result. Our government for all its faults has taken on a major job trying to formalise this practice in a way that respects cultures but ensures people have legal rights as well.Basically I think you have a certain idea of what marriage is. I think it is informed by seeing it through the eyes of a society that has benefited from the legal framework it exists in. You idealise what you think it was meant to be before governments got involved but you havent considered that it was always under some kind of law before it was just the Church and not government. The legal rights of people need to be protected within marriage and that is something the churches have not done adequately and are also not in any way responsible to do.I say churches because you have to consider other religions or cultures when you look at this situation.

After launching their Dont Be That Guy campaign where they educated men about what constitutes consent reports of rape fell by . There are also anecdotal reports of women describing what they considered rape since they did not consent but the guy took her absence of a no to mean yes without actually getting a consent.As another anecdoteinformal survey I went to a sexual assault awareness skit when I was in college and the situation was ambiguous enough that the audience an educated bunch was split as to whether the girl was raped or not. She never explicitly said yes but she never explicitly said no either. They were on a date she went to his home they had something like two drinks each he kissed her she kissed him back he took it to the next level she said afterward things escalated so quickly she didnt know how to respond her indecision cost her her window to say no just laid there and let him finish but felt violated.So while there will always be sociopaths simply educating men and women about what constitutes consent because a lot of men dont know could actually prevent a lot of rapes. And maybe you can correct me if Im missing something but I dont see how educating people about where the sometimes fuzzy boundary between consent and not consent demonizes anyone.

I believe this is wrong on many levels. The money may be misspent. This idea is NOT based on the assumption that poor people are all stupid or drug addicts. Its simply the fact that theres no way of ensuring that the cash is used for its intended purpose. The best assumption you can make is that people would be so desperately craving the thing you give them extra money for that they would almost certainly spend it on that but people may end up endure forms of squalor that were far from what the well intentioned policy makers had in mind. From the governments perspective money is also being spent inefficiently. Lets say a program wanted to ensure that people were well fed. Theyd have to find a cash amount that would buy enough healthy food to feed the recipients but people have different needs so theyll have to provide to the upper percentile of demand the alternative is weighing people paying women less etc. This not only will result in discretionary income but inequality in how much everyone gets. A food stamp system would allow everyone to get as much food as they need and the money left over is still in the governments hands to spend on other initiatives. Things like food stamps are patronising and thats a good thing. A cash handout creates a sense of entitlement beyond what something patronising like food stamps rent vouchers etc. create. By the time moneys in your pocket or bank account theres several layers between you and the people providing that service. Food stamps create a meaningful difference between working poor and welfare recipients to encourage escaping the system. Theres also the huge benefit of less resentment of those on welfare. In general they communicate purpose more clearly. Too often theres an attitude of getting as much money as you can from the government and paying as little tax as possible. It seems like people would be less likely to trick their way into receiving food stamps education and other initiatives purpose built to meet needs. On the other side I would think policies would allow people to see their taxes as less of a redistribution of wealth and more as funding for benevolent programs to create a better society.I think as much welfare as possible should be in the form of vouchers and other purpose specific non discretionary forms. I like food stamps I like rent vouchers I like free healthcare and education. Things like these over cash seem like the best way to prevent the safety net becoming a fishing net. I cant think of many situations where cash is the best option which is why Im here.The other aspect to this changemyview is that Im ok with policies that patronise the less fortunate. Being well fed healthy comfortably sheltered continually educated to eventually earn the life you want are more important than not being insulted.

By directly subsidizing housing in such a manner you cause incredible harm to people just outside of qualifying for the vouchers because you distort the low end of the housing market.Keep in mind the equilibrium point for rent prices on the bottom end of the market is set by what the poor can afford not the value of the property. You directly subsidize their rent and rent will eventually rise by exactly the amount you directly subsidize them for.

Not only that but you have to constantly explain your lack of relationships. People dont get why youve only dated one person years ago. People dont understand how you havent had sex in years and you dont find it particularly fun. These things make people uncomfortable. Its idealistic to think that work is supposed to be this professional environment where no one cares about your life but thats just not true. The people you work with want to know things about you they can relate to they want to see you start families get married at least be in relationships because its considered such an integral part of human life. Especially if youre a professional or executive your life does get scrutinized. Being asexual is still considered weird and often times thought to be a cover for some darker sexual proclivities even when its not. I understand that people who have relationships have to deal with leaving those relationships too. Ive watched my good friend go from shitty relationship to shitty relationship driven by loneliness or desire probably both. But you have to consider that even with the shitty breakups think of all the fun you had in your relationships. There had to have been some moments that were really great. Those moments would be gone too. And its not like you cant break an asexuals heart. Trust me I know. Youre still only human. The trick to advancing far in life isnt to want to be something else. You need to get intimately acquainted with you. I complain about being asexual but I wouldnt change who I am a bit out of fear but also because I decided not to live with regret. If you feel like youre vulnerable you need to figure out why and come to terms with it. Becoming asexual wouldnt fix those vulnerabilities itll at best switch them out with a different set. And try to look to the positives. The fact that you can experience love is already something really special.'},\n",

       "  'arguments': 'Before I begin Id like to commend those who are apart of the labor force who work their ass off to get by with minimum wage. Its an amazing thing nevertheless I respect those of you if any of you reading this are challenged to live off of it.Now to my view on the MW matter its an artificial ideology that should only be increased or manipulated in any way artificiallyby the fed in cases of an extreme change of the economy or the market. It should be eradicated to the point of only increasing or decreasing based off the economy at that point in time. As of now its the federal government stepping in and increasing the state MW. It should be there as a measurement of the inflation of currency and state of the market and to avoid any unfair affairs that would ensue based off a complete ridding of the MW. By increasing it were inflating the dollar and thus not actually paying our workers more for what they already do. Based off that statement alone we can infer the offered pay of jobs what that position is worth. Flipping burgers at a McDonalds is not worth as a lot of politicians might make it out to be. Its a job that is easily replaceable by automation. As previously stated by increasing the wages of lower tier workers were not helping them. The dollar is being inflated and so is worth less. They essentially have what they already have. Just in biggeryet proportional numbers. Furthermore our businesses will be the most affected by the increase of the MW. Having to pay more for a worker for doing the same job from before is a terrible business move. They will have to lay off more workers in order to compensate for their deficit just based off labor cost. Ive left out a lot of details in the debate over MW so keep in mind this isnt even scratching the surface. These are observations everyone can make obviously but on an indepth level there could be some positives to increase. Feel free to criticize my lack of indepth knowledge on the matter. Thanks for your time!',\n",
       "  'counters': 'All laws create an artificial impact. Thus to oppose one law and not another because one is artificial is contradictory. Its like saying I oppose this law because its a law which only makes sense if you are a complete anarchist. You cant simply apply the basic laws of supplyanddemand to humans the same way you can to consumer goods. Theres really few moral issues at stake as far as how much a pencil costs. If the price of pencils goes way down to the point that manufacturers cant make a profit some manufacturers will switch to other products in turn bringing the supply down allowing the price to go up and allowing others to stay in the business. However if the price of human labor goes below what a human needs to survive the human cant switch to being a tree or a rabbit. Theres a minimum that people need to survive regardless of what the supply and demand for labor currently is. The concerns about a higher minimum wage costing jobs is exaggerated. Businesses generally dont give out jobs as charity. If a place that has minimum wage workers can make more money with instead it would have already fired someone before any minimum wage increase happens. In reality just a small increase in price will usually make up for any minimum wage increases. This is very possible because... Increasing minimum wage increases demand. Its okay if McDonalds has to increase its Big Macs by cents after a minimum wage jump because now more people have money to spend on Big Macs. Finally consider that we also have welfare. Shouldnt companies be required at the very least to pay enough so their workers arent on welfare rolls as well? McDonalds customers benefit from the fact that the employees arent starving and looking like they sleep under a bridge and the owners benefit as well. Giving welfare to fulltime workers is essentially just a subsidy to business. I say let the customers and owners of a business be responsible for paying enough that their workers arent miserable barely surviving wrecks of human existence instead of making the taxpayer fill in the gap. If you want a hamburger served by someone who has had a meal and a shower in the last week I shouldnt have to pay for that. Thats on you.So to conclude a minimum wage is the humane thing to do its better for the economy as a whole and it saves the taxpayer money.'},\n",

You get the idea.Sure those movements make people feel better about themselves but it makes them content with who they are thinking theres nothing wrong with it and not try to improve. Theres a reason why they were traditionally thought of as weird.For example the fat acceptance movement makes obese people think there is nothing wrong with their bodies and ignore the health risks of being obese.While some nerds possess moderate social skills a lot of them dont have social skills good enough to make one friend in an anime convention of thousands of people. According to a poll used for an anime Family Feud in an anime convention at least make friends in a day convention with people of similar interests. Thats absurd.I cant speak for fat acceptance but as a previous nerd with no social skills it was the feeling of rejection that made me improve and push myself to hone my social skills.

Thats not to say that I am no longer a nerd I still have all my previous interests but I know when to talk about things I know not to correct people too much I know how to make small talk and in general be able to deal with people.As for fat acceptance it may not be an issue in a country where people pay for their own healthcare but in a country like Canada where everyone pays for healthcare this is an issue that affects everyone.

       "  'counters': 'Lets talk about the nerd one for a second. I dont think its fair to say that nerds necessarily have poor social skills. Mind you Im not arguing that nerdiness and poor social skills dont tend to go hand in hand Im saying that you can be a nerd with excellent social skills. Such a thing is quite possible and in fact fairly common. Heres the problem with nerd shaming by equating nerdy pursuits with poor social skills you discourage nerdy pursuits. For example theres nothing unsociable about an interest in math but if we equate nerdiness with poor social skills then being interested in math makes you in societys eyes unsociable. This discourages social people from pursuing nerdy interests thus reinforcing the stereotype. It also isolates nerds from society thereby worsening their social skills. This strengthens the stereotype and leads to a negative downward spiral. Therefore if we stopped shaming nerds nerds would be less socially awkward because they wouldnt be isolated and sociable people would be free to explore their nerdy interests. But perhaps more to your point lets not consider the shaming of nerdy people but the shaming of unsociable people in general. Id argue that contrary to your own personal experience shaming unsociable people tends to decrease self improvement. Why? Well lets consider how people handle criticism.When a person receives criticism even constructive criticism it erodes their sense of self worth. Now a well adjusted person with a healthy sense of self worth can withstand that erosion and use the criticism to be a strong sense of self worth through self improvement this is more or less the process you described. However lets consider what makes a person unsociable. Its from a lack of confidence which stems from a lack of self worth. Therefore an unsociable person simply wont handle criticism as well as the average person any given criticism amounts to a proportionally larger hit to their sense of self worth thereby worsening their dilemma. On the other hand a supportive environment where these people are accepted for who they are would allow them to build the confidence and self worth necessary to be a sociable person.'},\n",

       "  'counters': 'Right. So let me preface this by saying that any argument which touches on what is or is not moral will always fail since humankind has not yet reached a consensus on what morality is and whether it exists at all. Your argument as stated can be divided into into two parts which I will address independently. They are . Animals deserve the same rights as a human and . It is moral to liberate animals from places of abuse provided that this can be done without imposing violenceLets start with your first postulate. Animals deserve the same rights as humans. Thats a tricky one. Ill ignore the word deserves since it is impossible to logically prove or disprove. All available empirical evidence suggests that we live in a universe devoid of intentionality and thus any condition imposed by the outside world can never be said to be objectively deserved or undeserved. But behavior imposed by societies which are run by people and thus operate under intentional rules CAN be said to be deserved or undeserved to argue otherwise would be to deny that morality exists at all. So perhaps a better phrasing of this postulate would be It is moral to treat an animals life with the same care as we would treat a humans life and offer the animal the same protections we would expect for ourselves. With your indulgence Ill continue this discussion with that revised version of your initial statement in mind just to avoid a lot of pointless debate. The first counterpoint that occurs to me is this if society must treat an animals life and quality of life with the same importance as we place upon protecting our own then we must realize that we are not the worst criminals guilty of mistreating these creatures. Nature itself is brutal. Animals operating in the wild deal with constant scarcity hunger harsh conditions and the neverending threat of being stalked hunted and subjected to a painful death simply as a matter of routine living. Animals hunt and slaughter other animals all the time often viciously and utterly without remorse. source And since we cannot solve this problem in any practical way short of domesticating the entire planet we are already doomed to fail at our task. As shepherds tasked with protecting the quality of life of our animal friends we are hopelessly incapable.We of course do not expect animals to stop these behaviors as we recognize that these are merely survival behaviors and we accept that certain immoral behaviors can be deemed moral under lifethreatening circumstances. For example it is commonly cited that a starving child can hardly be considered a criminal for stealing a loaf of bread. Protecting life and quality of life can thus be considered a higher calling of morality and taking certain actions may be justifiable when viewed in this light. We also do not expect animals to stop hunting and killing one another because we dont expect them to know that they are supposed to. Animals have no concept of the notion of moral behavior or if they do we are even less able to agree upon what their concept of morality might be than we are able to agree upon one of our own. Thus the only creatures who can say with any level of certainty what would be moral treatment of an animal would be a human being. We can define this treatment any number of ways guaranteed access to sanitary living conditions protection from physical harm plentiful access to the exercise and socialization they might be accustomed to in their natural surroundings etc but we cannot escape from the fact that it is human beings who are deciding that these behaviors are to be deemed moral and ethical. And since we have this capability and animals evidently do not we cannot call an animal equal to a human being. If we would not hold an animal accountable for the same actions we would hold a person accountable for equality cannot exist. Thus the notion of interspecial equal rights is undermined as a fallacious concept even before we consider what the rights guaranteed should or should not be. If we claim ourselves to be external judges of morality and attempt to impose our moral judgments upon the animal kingdom then we have promoted ourselves to the role of managers and overseers from the very beginning. The idea of approaching the problem from a position of equality is impossible. And if you accept my premise that humans and animals are fundamentally unequal in this way then we have violated your premise that equal treatment is justified. We cannot treat the number three the same way we would treat the number four. Three and four are different. Humans and animals are different. Now if we accept my revised version of your argument we can partially avoid this fallacy. We are not asking the WORLD to treat the lives of animals with the same care that we in SOCIETY treat one another rather we are asking society itself to extend the rights and protections we enjoy to the animals we encounter merely through the course of our daytoday civilized lives. Why should that not be considered moral? If we read John Locke we see that a society is a collective who have consented to live by a social contract. We agree to give up the law of the jungle and with it our agency as animals in exchange for the protections of a state. This is a crucial point because the social contract as it currently exists is by design transactional. We give up one thing in exchange for the other. Animals do not participate in this social contract. As we have stated previously they do not give up their wild agency and we do not expect them to. Why then is it the responsibility of society to still uphold the social contract? Now would be a good time to touch on your second postulate. It is moral to liberate animals from places of abuse provided that this can be done without imposing violence. Imposing violence is asking someone to take a loss of some kind without just compensation. This can be unjustly taking money as in theft or agency as in slavery or life itself as in murder but always violence involves a onesided transaction imposed by force. If animals are fundamentally incapable of paying the entrance fee required by the social contract we would be imposing violence upon the state to require it to extend freely its valuable rights and privileges. Taking without giving is theft. Thus the only rational way to discuss animal rights within the context of society is to make this a civic issue rather than a moral one. We can agree that it is in our civic best interests to treat animals with care and respect because to do otherwise might tarnish or damage other precious pillars of our society. If we permit our citizens to behave as barbarians we risk undermining the social contract in kind. But it is equally true that lax treatment of animals is highly profitable and from a purely civil perspective since again we have eliminated morality as a logically consistent justification profits enhance quality of life across societies as a whole. If we argue that the most moral way to govern is to govern in the best interests of the citizens tightening regulations on animal treatment would be the same as denying our citizens those profits and thus imposing violence upon them. If protecting citizens from violence is more important than protecting noncitizens as is indeed the assumption fundamentally underlying our social contract and with it the entire incentive for which we all optin then extending animal rights can only be viewed as civic immorality. A governments civic duty under the social contract is simply to protect citizens from violence and to promote gains in standard of living. Your second postulate is the following It is moral to liberate animals from places of abuse provided that this can be done without imposing violence. And thats the bad news. It isnt possible to do this without imposing violence at least if we consider financial hardships hunger lost wages and unemployment forms of violence. If promoting animal rights was more profitable than ignoring them that would be moral from a civic standpoint. That isnt the world we live in. SUMMARY Humans and animals are not equal beings and therefore the idea that they merit equal treatment is flawed. Animals can only receive moral treatment so long as there are humans to determine and agree upon what moral treatment means. If morality is a human construct the idea that it should apply to animals is also flawed. Indeed we can see every day that the wild world of nature is brutal and immoral by human standards. If we use morality to apply only to human beings and to guide our treatment of animals we also encounter contradictions. If we set out to treat animals the same way we would treat one another we are elevating animals to a place in society they have not earned under the social contract. If the social contract is invalid all society is invalid and the notion of morality is invalid along with it. If we argue that animals do not merit equal standing with humans in our society but that society should still treat animals with a specific and regulated level of care we are harming the economy and imposing violence and poverty upon our citizens. Since no government can be called moral who would harm its own citizens it would be impossible for a government to take those actions and still call itself legitimate.

If they are killed painlessly after having had the benefit mere existence brings were they not better off than never having existed? Why is that the alternative... because of option .Option We ban the sale or consumption of meat. A huge number of animals only exist to provide us with meat to consume. Without humans actively breeding raising and caring for them tens of billions of cows trillions of chickens etc. alive today would for all intents and purposes represent the last generation of their species. Yes there would be free roaming cows in the future but likely only one for every million cows alive today.

Do you think for these animals at their level of awareness there is a value in being free as opposed to living in option ?Option Animals are used in medical testing that results in significant pain and suffering to the animal. Do you think there is some level of human suffering that would be eliminated as a direct result of such experimentation that same would be justified? For example if a doctor learns how to repair infants hearts by practicing on a baby baboon and three baby baboons are killed allowing that surgeon to save a thousand human infants in their career that this would be morally acceptable?I think everyone would agree that animals used by man shouldnt suffer. However they exist only so that one day we can use them as food. If an alien said to an unborn you that you could only exist if after years of safety relative comfort and a reasonable quality of life you would be painlessly used as food for that alien would you rather not exist?

       "  'arguments': 'Posting with a throwaway as my position manages to offend both sides of the spectrum.For a long time I believed that abortion was immoral but I eventually became convinced based largely on utilitarian grounds that abortion was permissible.So why do I believe that most abortions are immoral? For an act to be moral doesnt just mean that it is permissible according to ethics but you need to actually know that it is moral.Most people dont understand the issue well enough to know abortion is moral. In fact most or at least a large proportion of people dont know much of anything. For example only of people dont believe that global warming is caused by human activity. Only of people in the US believe in evolution of registered voters believe Obama is a Muslim Of those a large percent probably only say that they believe in evolution or global warming because their friends do. If their friends said the opposite then theyd probably think that the scientists were just making it up too.So thats on scientific issues that are relatively clear cut. Philosophical issues are much more messy. What percentage of people male and female do you believe actually understand the issue and arent just quoting whatever theyve heard other people say?From the way that these discussions go it seems to be very small. Lots of people identify viability as the point where a foetus deserves moral consideration but they cant articulate a reason why theoretical ability of foetus to survive outside of a womb should be connected to metaphysical rights indeed this is a weak argument philosophically.Many people try to construct a right of bodily autonomy but the situations differ in the important respect that the mother knowing put themselves in a position where there was a risk of pregnancy. Because of this distinction bodily autonomy doesnt work as a contradiction argument only as an analogy to aid intuition.Now while there are strong philosophically justified utilitarian grounds and other more nuanced arguments within other moral frameworks I would be surprised if more than of the population could provide a logically coherent argument. To be clear Im sure that many of the people here can restructure these arguments to be much more logically coherent except that isnt really the point here the point is that most people are logically incoherent.Objection Does any of this matter? If someone does something that is morally acceptable and they believe that it is morally acceptable then arent they in the clear?Not quite. Someone has to also take due diligence. Suppose someone who believes in utilitarian ethics is going to go back in time and kill Hitler. This will have a good result it will save millions of lives and they strongly believe this. But before they get a chance they run into another timetraveller with an oracle machine that can tell them if their action is good or bad perhaps another leader will take over who kills even more than Hitler. If they choose to put their hands in their ears and not listen to the oracle their act to kill Hitler cannot be considered moral because they were gambling with millions of lives by changing the course of world history and ignoring evidence that might have shown it disastrous. This applies even if the result is that they save millions of lives. The point is that for an action to be moral it isnt sufficient for it to be morally acceptable and for the person to believe that it is morally acceptable but one needs to also take an appropriate level of care when coming to that decision.In the same way human life is hugely valuable and someone who has an abortion without making a rather significant effort to ensure that they understand the issue is acting immorally as they are not taking the appropriate level of care.Most people if they were truly honest would have to admit that they dont really understand the issue and therefore cannot be justified in having an abortion without knowing that they have solid arguments to support their position.Change my view.',\n",

       "  'arguments': 'When someone is in high school it does not make sense to have a committed romantic relationship. Romantic relationship is defined as a mutual agreement of exclusivity in dating and being referred to as together.The first point I have is that in a purely practical sense dating should be seen from a breadth first approach. It is more pragmatic to date many people and learn what your particular tastes are than to learn it by stumbling through a series of relationships that fall apart and tripping right into the next one. This is emotionally taxing.Second as teenagers have not matured enough yet to what they will be as adults. You cant really understand the significance of that intimacy at that time. One just is not ready until a later ageThird relationships are distracting expensive and time consuming. High school is often what decides the course of someones life and it is not wise to mess with something that powerful. I have seen many people throw their lives away for their boyfriend or girlfriend and it seems that it just is not worth the risk.Answer this and I will be convinced Is it vital that someone gets relationship experience in high school? Would in not be bennifical to date noncommittally until after graduation?To support this I point to the statistic brought up by utomrhod... A closer look at even these lower rates indicate that there are really two separate groups with very different rates a woman who is over has a college degree and an independent income has only a percent probability of her marriage ending in divorce a woman who marries younger than without a college degree and lacking an independent income has a percent probability of her marriage ending in divorce.Please The multitude of stories changed my view.

However positive raindrops early in life teach people especially men how to be better mates and parents.As the above study notes teenagers who dont date are more likely to engage in fwb or hookup situations which are worse than serious relationships for a variety of reasons.That said the literature available acknowledges that teenagers who date seriously are at higher risk for negative relationships and pregnancy as well as divorce. Three things to address there . Teens are much more impressionable and under more supervision than adults on average. This means there are greater opportunities for correction and education on what a healthy relationship is . adequate sex ed has been proven to lower pregnancy rates. . The talks about serious relationships not marriage. If we talk about marriage in this context I happen to agree however the prompt said relationships.

Technology tends to always increase over time and crime can fluctuate in a longterm pattern. Just because its falling now doesnt mean it will continue to do so indefinitely.As for quality of life increasing this is questionable. The United States has been experiencing increased income inequality since at least which hasnt been made any better by the huge number of government cuts that were seen in the s and the s under Reagan Bush and Clinton. Many of these cuts were justified by claiming that it is the individuals choice to not work a better job which grossly misunderstands the point of income mobility if you close the path to helping people move up the social ladder their situation at the bottom will make them fail to do so.Besides that there are a number of factors that suggest that the US is slowly slipping into decline The US has the worlds highest incarceration rate with out of every americans being in jail or prison. A great deal of these people are minor offenders who are in jail for no more than possessing marijuana being homeless or being a minority in the wrong place at the wrong time. The US is also one of only a handful of countries with private prison facilities but by far has the most. These prisons have in the past been accused of such things as bribing judges to send children to jail for minor offences or in some cases no offences and lobbying local governments to create new crimes to send people to jail for The state of public education in the United States is in a downturn. Despite the US being tied in first with Switzerland in annual spending per student many teachers find themselves spending their own money on supplies for their students and the disparity in funding between some public schools is astounding. Some states also believe that they should be teaching evolution and Christian creationism side by side acting as though Creationism is a legitimate scientific view which it obviously isnt. American culture is becoming stupider and promoting poor behaviour. Hit shows such as Jersey Shore and Pregnant and Keeping Up With the Kardashians promote binge drinking underage unprotected sex and general mediocrity. Younger audiences which are particularly susceptible to media are picking up on the behaviours they see on TV and emulating them. In American teenagers were getting more pregnant than any other country with available data and only recently does evidence suggest that this phenomenon might be going down. Bipartisanship in government is increasing. RepublicanDemocrat bipartisanship is no new ordeal but in recent years especially since the election of Obama and the fallout of the Iraq war it has increased dramatically and arguably has divided much of the nation. The peak of course was the federal government shutdown in which the United States went without most federal services for a full days because Congress and the President couldnt agree on a budget. The fact that such a thing can even happen in the first place is bewildering to people in most other countries especially developed ones but the fact that it came about because of such a sharp ideological difference between the Republican Lower House and the Democratic Presidency should be startling to Americans and should definitely serve as a wake up call that the current system of government isnt working in such a polarized society. The USA is experiencing the militarization of police like no developed country has ever seen. Mostly due to overproduction by military manufacturers or from the sale of older equipment by the military to local police forces to minimize loss local police forces are purchasing military equipment for everything from antiterrorism to border security and of course curbing protests. In as much as .B in grant money was awarded to local departments for spending on military gear as well as a total of .B since through the US Defense Logistics Agency DLAs program This has been criticized as excessive for typical law enforcement and has been even more criticized in the wake of the Ferguson protests where it has been used not just to quell protestors but arguably to aggravate more protests occupy the town of Ferguson and quell dissent altogether. Militarization of police also shows a great distrust of the local government to its people and makes the assumption that the citizen is the enemy.Certainly other countries do face similar issues that are on this list. However when combined they cause a malady of problems in the United States that arguably are moving American society in the wrong direction. A country with such enormous production capability and human potential can do much better than where its at now. However people seem adamant in doing anything about it especially when the answer involves higher taxes or more spending.Some countries such as the Netherlands and Japan seem to avoid this by coincidence both are dense countries and the need for cooperation and organization is high. In the Netherlands no one questions zoning laws put forth by the government because everyone understands the dike system keeps the country above sea level. In Japan employees no matter where they work understand their position in society and are not often eager to demand more than what they have. CEOs have also been known to selfregulate their incomes to ensure that employees are also earning a standard wage.I would argue that much of the problem in the US is a lack of organization and cooperation between people. Americans arent as easily able to grasp communalism or socialism or see them as beneficial because both infringe on their individual liberties on which the country is based. People need to get out of the mindset of putting themselves first and think for a moment about how they fit in to their society.As John F. Kennedy said in his inaugural address And so my fellow Americans ask not what your country can do for you ask what you can do for your country.'},\n",

       "  'arguments': 'Whenever I hear a schools teachings on antibullying I often see a very dangerous idea being taught to every student. To me activehelpful bystander henceforth known as active bystander mentality is an irresponsible teaching because it is dangerous relieves the school of a lot of responsibility and weakens the success rate of stopping bullying.Being an active bystander is dangerous because it redirects the flow of aggression from the previous victim to the person who decided to intervene. The aggression could be anything from just hateful words being thrown to something as severe as a lifeendingcrippling weapon being pointed at the new defender not necessarily a gun maybe a knife or something else. It forces the defender to cover both himherself as well as the initial victim. On top of this if there are other bystanders who choose to be harmful harmful bystanders now the defender has to defend against or more people. This on top of the fact that the victim may or may not be helpful in the repelling of the bully helps to ensure that from a safety point being an active bystander is not the best idea.Active bystanders also remove much of the burden from the school. When schools essentially appoint everyone as a militia against bullying it rids itself of much of the duty to detect bullying as it happens. As I mentioned earlier active bystanders themselves may not be powerful enough to even stop the threat. Without the cooperation of the school overall people will have a much weaker antibullying effort. If a fight actually takes place the school can just shrug it off by enforcing zeropolicy and suspend both the active bystander. This doesnt even solve the problem for a few reasons. The bully either a didnt mean what they saiddid and just had their emotions get in the way therefore feeling like they were unfairly treated or b dont care about school or their peers and do this for whatever reason they want to. For the defender well they just got rekt due to their fail at bullying and from the victims perspective they probably feel cheated for getting punished for something they could not control.My view could be changed if someone could find a better solution that repels the bully nulls the aggression and gives the schools some responsibility.Please convince me if I got something wrong about my logic.',\n",

You give some good arguments for not being an active bystander when a fight breaks out but for most other types of bullying it would really help.I you call out a bully for being an asshole the bully will realise the bullying is harming their social standing not just with the kid being bulied but with everyone. This works especially if the active bystander is a friendpeer of the bully.One danger of being a active bystander is that the bully will focus their attention on you. This is why it is especially important that everyone is a active bystander a bully cant bully ten people at the same time.Some bullies might not think of their actions as being bullying. They might think its just taunting or might not realize how big the impact of their words and actions really are. The simple act of calling them out once might make them see their mistake.Most fighting involved in bullying is an escalation of previous bullying. If you stop the early bullying you might prevent later violence.If everyone becomes an active bystander bullies will have to stop bullying or become social outcast and lose their power.'},\n",

       "  'arguments': 'With regards to sandwiches triangular cuts are far superior to rectangular cuts and should be the only ones ever used. Every time I use sliced bread I end up cutting it triangularly. Toast sandwiches grilled cheese etc. I think it is the best way and that sandwiches on traditional sliced bread should be cut this way. So Im not referring to subsetc. I will also allow patti melts as an exception although I prefer them cut still. My boyfriend barely ever slices sandwiches when he cooks and when he does he tends to go with rectangular. Most likely to spite me because I cant think of any reason to ever use that style of cutting. So my views are that sandwiches should always be sliced and they should be sliced in a triangular fashion from corner to corner with the above noted exceptions and specifications. First a sliced sandwich is always superior to one that has not been sliced. It allows you direct access to the middle where the most flavor is. It also cuts down on the amount of crumbs created. You are also able to completely avoid eating the crust this way if you prefer. Second the triangular slice is always superior to the rectangular slice. If you have a dipping sandwich such as grilled cheese with tomato soup the triangular shape allows you to fit the sandwich into a container much easier since you have a smaller tip. They also fit around a bowl much easier as triangles. can also regulate how much of the sandwich you bit off easier. You can see much more of the insides of the sandwich to inspect where you might want to bite. The triangle is a stronger shape than a rectangle so you can support the sandwich with less effort. When you eat the insides of the sandwich the triangle leaves a much more manageable crust than the rectangular cuts. uNepene gets a delta for convincing me that rectangle cut is superior in ONLY ONE WAY when transporting in ziplock baggies. And that it is an acceptable option although inferior option when eating a sandwich that would involve dipping in soup. I dont think there are any other situations where a rectangle cut would be better or acceptable.',\n",
       "  'counters': 'There are many reasons why you might prefer the rectangular cut.You note that the triangular cut exposes more middle bread to the air more food. This is also a downside. If you leave them for a while they will go slightly stale dry out faster as they are more exposed. For a utilitarian mind which may want a sandwich at any time perpendicular is the way to go.The wide and varying width of the triangular cut makes it harder to avoid getting food on your mouth wasted. As you slide it in its easier for the edge to hit the corner of your mouth. This can be a big issue for a man in a rush if you get mayo in your beard its gonna be hard to get out.Its also easier to stack a lot of them. With a rectangle you just put them on top of each other. With a triangle? Thats more of an issue. Their floppiness means you can soon have a mess of ugly looking sandwiches falling over one another.Triangle sandwiches can often actually lead to more damage. Because of the shape if you put it in a ziplock bad then you tend to draw it out through a corner. This can lead to tearage and slippage of food.Provides a consistent dip into soup. With a triangle the wideness often blocks you dipping it deep enough meaning you have to scrunch it or dip it eat it and then dip it again and burn your fingers a bit. A square or rectangle shape which has a consistent width is easier to dip.'},\n",

Here are some reasons why I think they are better. Wired Mice are way cheaper. I bought mine for and all the other wireless mice started for at least . Wired Mice dont need batteries so they wont run out of battery midgame or during anything important meaning that you wont have any interruptions. The wire makes it easy to keep track of as it is connected to the computer so swiping it accidentally off of your desk youll still be able to find it. Its a much more reliable connection and doesnt randomly disconnectstop working while using it where as in my experience wireless mice fade in and out occasionally. ?',\n",

You had to go to three stores to find your mouse and barely didnt have to continue searching for a fourth.Youre right here there isnt much of an argument against you. I can say that with better batteries and lower power demands from the mice it doesnt happen that often I have to recharge my mouse once a week or so so this problem with wired mice isnt that bad. Its worth noting here that this is the mouse that I use. I payed for it not because it turns out that you can negotiate prices at Best Buy.While this is also technically true its a rare circumstance that will vary based on a persons clumsiness or their roommates clumsiness if you are about to start college.This isnt really an issue with modern wireless mice. Ive never had a problem with it. Conceivably a problem would arise if you have a lot of metal between your mouse and its receiver but this is unlikely.The biggest disadvantage to wired mice is the limited mobility which for many users like myself makes their setups nonviable. I use a desktop that I ironically like to keep under my desk. I dont want to have to keep my mouse within six feet of it at all times and I dont want to have to deal with yet another long cable running between my computer and a peripheral. My keyboard is wired which I can tolerate because it remains stationary but a wired mouse is constantly moving and my experience is that the wire will be blocked by various items on my desk limiting the mobility again or will even push things around which I find annoying. You also cant take your hand off of the mouse without the pointer moving if the cable happened to rest against an object on your desk which is very annoying if you just fullscreened a video and dont want to move the mouse. Also if you take your laptop anywhere and want to bring your mouse with you you will have to deal with the cable at your new location. In some places this will be fine but in a cramped conference room or lecture hall the wire will only hinder you.If you dont mind another cable coming from your computer you dont mind having your computer near where you want to use your mouse and youre using a laptop so thats fine you dont mind it when the wire gets in the way of the mouses movements and you dont mind the mouse moving on its own when you let go of it or these issues arent worth the extra and trip to extra stores then a wired mouse is for you but I think that there clearly is not a universal advantage to wired mice.'},\n",

After a while they realized that they werent actually upset about the issues they were fighting about or each other. They were just forgetting to eat lunch and getting irritable from low blood sugar.We dont have a mind reading device so we can never truly know anyones innermost thoughts but we can get some good clues from a number of sources.As much as the conservative narrative is that this is an issue about the fetus but not the womans rights a lot of the details of how conservatives approach the dialogue makes me doubt that.The large majority of conservatives support an exception for rape and incest Think about that. It means that the life of the fetus is no longer the first priority when it was not the womans choice to have sex. Thats very much about the womans choice isnt it?Responses to moral thought experiments are also telling. In western society the right to life does not trump bodily autonomy. I cant be forced to donate my kidney if youll die without one. From the conservative perspective people shouldnt even be forced to part with money to save others lives. Theres a thought experiment about a famous violinist Basically the idea is you wake up to find that you have been drugged and while you were under your kidneys have been hooked up to an ailing famous violinist to keep him alive. He will die if you disconnect. The question is whether it is ethical to do so or if one must be forced to remain connected.Very very few people say that one has an ethical duty to remain connected. People stick by the notion that bodily autonomy is given precedence over the lives of others. So prolife conservatives generally have a number of objections to the applicability of the thought experiment to abortion. These objections show that to conservatives this isnt ultimately only about the fetuss life. They object that a woman having sex knew the risk and someone hijacked for a violinist would not. They argue that a woman has a special duty to her child that does not exist between other humans.All of these objections show that it isnt the preservation of life thats paramount but a particular view of the womans responsibility that overrides her freedom of choice.'},\n",

I personally am more like you I can talk about whatever with friends and it isnt personal with me but I do have a few friends who have their views and they are quite passionate about them enough to where some topics can quickly escalate into a not so friendly conversation. I dont consider those friends to be shallow or immature they are just people who have a different view than I do about something and they have a ton of passion in their beliefs and ideas enough to where they cant always keep things on that topic not personally. With that in mind the question I have to answer from your is if it is shallow and immature to have enough passion about a belief or idea political view to where I take things about it personally. I dont believe that it is. In many ways it is a good thing in two ways. A person who is very passionate about something and they do take it personally can rally others around their beliefs and points of view which if that is a good belief or idea is a good thing. The other side of the coin is if its a bad belief or idea then the more passionate and adamant they are it strengthens resolve against those ideas or beliefs. Those people are a key piece of the big picture and a help for everyone really in figuring out personal beliefs and ideas. If you remove the idea of something being wrong or right then it is simply a person who is passionate about an idea. I just cant see that as being shallow or immature.

Protection from a government that some gun owners have decided is behaving tyrannical? Provision for the guerilla war well need to fight when an alien war machine arrives from the other end of the universe to assimilate us?While I would accept that it could mean any of these things Id argue its not incontrovertibly true that it does mean any of them in particular although I would suspect that to many defense from foreign invasion would be the concern that would trump all others. You can definitely find perspectives from some of the founding fathers that support the view that the second amendment should act as a check on the governments own potential for tyranny but that is true of pretty much everything thats in the constitution you can consult the various founders written views on everything and end up with a wealth of disagreement as to what purpose each article and amendments should serve as well as to their limits and purview. Hence why we have a court system that exists to debate these issues since we dont have the founders around to poll for their specific thoughts on every conflict that arises.Another issue that confounds the matter is that while the second amendment protects gun ownership at least in some sense the extent of which has been debated for ages the Constitution also contradictorily empowers the federal government to put down rebellions. So we have two ideas that are sort of at crosspurposes. Youre saying were supposed to use guns to resist but the response to that could well be The government is obligated to use force to quash your resistance and the potential threat it represents to the safety and stability of the republic.Lemme turn your founding father example around for a sec to look at it from the other side. A bunch of religious fundamentalists get together and say Well fuck we dont like that the government allows for any kind of legal abortions anywhere. We think its a sin and we cant believe the government is oppressing human life by sanctioning it! Fuck democracy lets start an armed rebellion and show these bastards that they cant enforce their tyranny on us! Get your guns and lets storm the capitol!Are these people in the right? Are they not using the same reasoning you are? They believe themselves to be using force via the second amendment to resist the overreach of a tyrannical government.If the second amendment exists to protect what political theorists sometimes refer to as the right of revolution then what determines when the exercise of that right is just? Am I allowed to murder agents of the government and defend myself by claiming that the second amendment enshrines my right to do so in protection of my interests? If Id be wrong to claim this why would it be so?Its a thorny problem of recognizing that its easy to support a constitutional right to violent resistance when its in defense of a cause you support but a lot tougher when its a cause you find abhorrent.'},\n",

Thats ok in my opinion it is a living document and meant to be changed as times change but the history is a little different than most people think.The well regulated militia they speak of does not refer to self organized citizens but rather state run armies. Militias as used by the states are different than the Army Navy National Guard ect by operating on a state level rather than federal. Meaning the President gives marching orders for the whole nation. Even if the people of say Georgia disagree with a national decision their soldiers are ordered to go along with it. The Georgia Militia however could do what it likes. It all comes down to the big fear of the time which was big government. They did not imagine individuals would fight the power but that the nd amendment would allow states to protect themselves from other states when the Fed would not get involved and protect themselves from the Federal government itself. One of the more popular uses of the state militia was to suppress slave insurrections in southern states. Many of us know that there was talk during the writing of the constitution about abolishing slavery but it never came to fruition. Well if all the armed power belonged to the federal government and then the federal government refuses to support slavery the slavery dependent states would not be able to exert the necessary power. They therefore needed to keep their militias. Some of the antifederalist of the time used unchecked slave uprising as a talking point against the constitution we wont even be able to defend ourselves! whether that would have been true or not who can say. Thus the second amendment was born. I dont have the citiations for this at the moment I remember reading a study on it back in college if anyone is looking for more info I know the historical record of this comes from George Masons speeches to Virginia and some of James Madisons writings.

This might mean that startups like Uber or Lyft cannot operate while at the same time putting more power into the hands of those able to afford the million dollar taxi licenses it costs around that much in New York. This political outcome could mean the rich get more overall income so they gain overall wealth while paying more taxes so also gaining more political power. This example was thought of quickly but there are surely ways the rich could be benefited other than lowering taxes.Also this might create other types of minority groups. The rich might not favor policies hurting the poor directly but it seems plausible that rich people would tend to be in a certain age range and then might start targeting politically powerless groups for some kind of discrimination.I think your approach makes sense in a lot of ways but the consequences are so hard to anticipate that it might cause more harm then good.'},\n",

       "  'arguments': 'We currently have a voting system which equally weighs each persons choice. We see this system used in many things like in tv shows. The Voice for example I think that this is a wonderful and fair system which works well when all voters have sufficient skill to judge candidates. In The Voice the audience is adequately equipped to decide who is the best singer. People are fully capable of voting on things like their favorite ice cream or their favorite tv show.This system breaks down when the voters do not have the necessary skills or knowledge to make a proper judgement. Take for example a boxing match. Many matches go to the judges and most members of the audience do not have boxing experience. If the audience were allowed to vote for the winner it would often result in the winner being chosen via a popularity contest rather than by the rules of the ring. Most people watching a match would not be able to give an accurate judgement of the match simply because their seat in the stadium or their seat in front of a tv does not permit them to reliably count the number of clean punches.Lets take another example Net Neutrality. Most people probably spent minutes reading an article by someone who spent minutes googling the subject before writing. And now they think they know everything there is to know. The Net Neutrality documents are hundreds of pages and would take weeks to read through and analyze. Industry experience would be a requirement in making a proper decision. See the danger of letting the average person cast a vote?Finally lets address the voting of political candidates. Each candidate represents an allegiance to a bundle of different policies which represents thousands of pages of documents which can represent years of reading and analysis. Understandably citizens are not allowed to vote on individual policies.The only alternative to an equal weight system is to weigh the votes differently. I believe that each person should have a number of votes equal to the amount of federal taxes paid for the previous year or some variation like average of past years.This would be the effects Any attempt for the wealthy to reduce their taxes will result in destroying their own voting power. This is key and many people dont get this. The system is self correcting in that you cannot choose to not pay tax and also control the government at the same time. You would get a vote size proportional to your contribution to society. It seems rather fair that you should have a bigger say of what to do with the money if you contribute more. There is a high correlation between intelligence and income. Weighing votes this way would help to put more voting power into the hands of people who are more likely to make better decisions. Well finally be able to have smart politicians instead of popular politicians in office. From what Ive seen the smartest politicians who can actually address issues are not popular. Any time a politician goes into specifics of why something has to be a certain way the audience doses off. Most of America wants to be entertained with buzzwords and it often results in candidates manipulating the voters into voting against their own interests.',\n",

If what we thought was true is proven to be false we change our view and incorporate the new truths. The argument that we cant prove that there isnt a creator is pretty much circular reasoning. No we cant prove he doesnt exist but the religious cant prove that a creator does exist either. So lack of evidence leads us to the mindset that no a creator does not exist given the lack of evidence. Now if we did get evidence we would likely change our minds i know I would.Religion does cause a vast majority of conflicts in the world.

       "  'counters': 'I think you are on the right track however you have failed to highlight the source of the problem. An illinformed populace is only a symptom of the diseasea poor education system. While America still ranks fairly high globally for education amp developed many of the educational methods used in other countries they often dont apply here. Inadequate pay for teachers and issues with school funding being assigned by property tax mean that schools arent often great duly many lowincome people will not receive a good education or foundation for logic. Later down the line they dont have as much knowledge regarding child rearing for ex reading to a child will help them learn good vocabulary and more that will ultimately perpetuate this cycle unless the educational system improves. Becoming educated on issues is not as easy as you thinkwhile for you and I who clearly have enough free time to browse reddit access to internet a computer and readingtyping skills browsing alternative news sources may be a clear option a great majority of people only receive their news from Fox CNN and other media outlets that only present a narrow view. These mainstream news sources often only present the narrow Republican vs. Democrat view instead of recognizing that perhaps both parties are wrong and stuck catering to corporate interests. Even more people never think on their own seriously of Americans do not spend any part of their day thinking. Its fairly difficult to sit back and muse upon the merits of various social programs when you are concerned with making ends meet or supporting a family. For most people thoughts and worries are always running in their head amp they dont want to think about the worlds issues just survive the day. Like you I find it very hard to believe that anyone could not be concerned with the major issues of our time amp not set out to find the truth on their own but many dont have the educational backing free time or mental bandwidth.I encourage you to approach this issue from a compassionate standpoint amp try and sympathize with those who did not receive a strong educational foundation. Meanwhile focus on correcting the issue if it bothers you so muchspread awareness and advocate for news sources that provide educational awareness on issues think websites like Vox. On a final note consider the dramatically different backgrounds most people in America come from. How can we possibly expect someone from a religious small town in Kansas to agree with an individual raised in a big Eastern city?

But what I will tell you is that youre missing the biggerpicture democracy not just the American populace has the fundamental issue of illinformity. The intention of our system of government isnt necessarily about what is right or wrong. Thats weird to type and kind of weird to read but when you choose to participate in a democracy you participate in a system which you value the freedom of the individuals. You give everyone an equal vote because we are assuming everyone is of equal value as a person. We are choosing to give everyone freedom at the cost of maybe losing sight of what could be potentially right or wrong. I mean what if we had a monarchy with a philosopher king who perfectly knew economics politics government systems international relationships moral systems philosophy mathematics science etc and who was perfectly just? Would we need a democracy then if he made all the laws all the decisions set all the precedents? Its too bad an individual like that hasnt come about we are too constrained by our biology our emotions our lack of time our obligations. But if there were such a person why would we need democracy? Let him do everything for us. Oh except now theres a time constraint. There are millions of people in America alone.That was a bit of a tangent but incredibly relevant I think. For the most part we are stuck with a democracy. The cost of the democracy is the issue youre highlighting lack of general knowledge. But could there be reasons for that?I think there are. Education isnt a new thing but the nature of the beast is everchanging. Now more than ever more and more people are getting an education. But there is only so much which can be beneficial to the political process. Assuming a perfectly knowledgeable population with an equal distribution of all fields of academia youre still only highlighting a minor percent of the population which could be constructive to the political process. Economics political science law philosophy. A PhD in quantum physics or whatever is spectacular but id be surprised if that person even had the toolkit to analyze the minimum wage properly. I mean im an economics major I love economics breath it but even I hardly have the toolkit to properly analyze the minimum wage. And so now we are at the crux of the issue remove the assumption that the population is perfectly knowledgeable. Add in reallife constraints. You ever had to scrub toilets for a living? Serve tables? Fix cars? Clean pools? hours a week maybe more or maybe you have to drive across town for your second job. Maintain your family. Make sure your lawn is up to standards. Pay your bills. Figure out this years taxes. Sometimes you want to go home and have a beer or smoke a joint because you got your ass kicked at work. This my friend is the average person. Not some dumb grim looking Orwellianesque knuckledragging mongrels. Some of us are distracted. Some of us just have different values entirely who is to say that they absolutely should be concerned with the political process and all the shit that comes with it?My dad is the average person. Works his ass off for my family. hours a week no overtime he gets salary. Hes not dumb. He didnt go to college but he can maintain conversations on some political and philosophical topics can be skeptical to some things etc. Why on earth would it be in his own rational self interest to pick up an economics text book analyze it learn it breathe it just as I do and then go on to political science and then law and then philosophy just to have one vote which is as much say as anyone else who isnt informed? This is called the freerider problem which is something the current political system tries to remedy but at the same time still give the freedom of choice to the individual.This is a really exhaustive topic to be honest.

       "  'counters': 'Growing up I had a few fun places within a easy bike ride or walking distance. I mostly ended up spending my summers at the local pool because I loved swimming so much but there were also some nearby parks and fields that I could have spent my time in. As I got older I spent most of my time at the high school which was within walking distance about a mile.When I was ten if I wanted to play soccer all I needed was to take the ball into the back yard. This was also true of sledding in the winter climbing trees digging up rocks and most other fun things I would want to do as a ten year old. Some things were better done in the front where we would utilize the black top of our seldom trafficked culdesac to play basketball baseball hockey and many other things. Your ice cream point would also have been irrelevant to me as a year old because while there was an ice cream van that came by regularly my parents would never let me have any because they wanted to control my sugar intake. At that age even if I had access to the money which I did and a non moving store my parents would still have disallowed buying ice cream and would have punished me if I had taken the initiative to do so on my own.Raised in the suburbs and I didnt get a car until I was . Even then it was a car that my parents would have sold for not very much money when they got a new one but instead gave to me. At the age of I have only within the last month bought my own car for the first time.I do agree with you that rural environments provide much better situations for children than the suburbs do but I think that you are underestimating the access to some of these things that some suburbs provide. In the house I currently live in still very much suburbs it backs to woods and a small creek. A short walk away is a local park with more developed woods read larger uninterrupted acreage and a thriving stream system. It isnt as much as I can get when Im in the mountains but it isnt non existent. As for the things the rural kids you know learned how to do I did learn most of those while growing up. I built structures with my dad helped my mom in our vegetable garden not livestock but a similar usefulness of the skill and I learned how to shoot through my high school on a competitive team I have been to competitions recently where I am competing against mostly rural people who grew up shooting and hunting and I beat them all.Where I am there are more youth athletic programs than I know what to do with and I would be hard pressed to find someone who didnt do any growing up. Every neighborhood has a pool within walking distance and my high school regularly is competing for the state championship in some sport or another and producing NCAA athletes even a few for that went pro.Overall I find myself unable to imagine what it would be like to raise a kid in a city because that lack of space would kill any sort of fun activity I could think of them doing besides staying at home and being couch potatoes. I think that a rural environment is ideal but the suburbs can work fine if you need to be near a city for work.'},\n",

       "  'arguments': 'I believe that the suburbs are a worse environment to raise children in than either more rural areas or more urbanized areas generally speaking. Im aware there was a on this subject not too long ago However theres a few points I feel werent made there. Ill try to avoid treading over the same ground.For one my idea of an urban area is one where most amenities are in range of walking biking or a relatively short bus ride. This includes schools shops parks etc. This was brought up in the past AMA but the discussion didnt really include a comparison of accessibility. Cities can generally be navigated without a car because they usually preceded the car. Suburbs on the other hand were designed explicitly around cars the feasibility of walking wasnt taken into consideration by planners developers or business owners when placing public spaces and private businesses.This critical distinction means that while suburbs may have shops parks libraries and of course schools children are completely dependent on their parents for access. This is not conducive to raising kids with an independent mindset. Where the urban year old who wants to play soccer see his friends or buy an icecream cone can simply get up and go the suburban kid has to ask her parents who then have to agree to take time out of their day to drive her down. Furthermore the urban kid would get passive exercise if he walked or biked to where he was going the suburban kid rarely has that option for reasons of distance or safety. When she turns the suburban kid does have the option of getting a car. However this means thousands of dollars have to be dedicated to getting the independence and freedom that the urban kid has already had for years. The urban yearold is more likely to spend money from a job on something other than basic transportation.These criticisms also all apply to rural areas but those have one critical offset access to space. My childhood was spent between rural western Washington state and rural eastern Oregon. In both cases though my neighborhoods might have resembled suburbs there was a lot of undeveloped unfenced land around. My friends might have had to be dropped off by their parents but once they were there we went exploring in the woods or desert built forts rode bikes played war. When I got older we could play paintball. Other kids in the neighborhood rode dirt bikes. Though we didnt have access to ball fields or libraries in walking distance we did have the forest W Washington or desert E Oregon as a playground. Other rural kids that I have known have learned to build small structures raised livestock or learned target shooting.In short the design of the suburbs makes it almost impossible to get around without a car. This prevents children who grow up there from developing independent problemsolving abilities that their urban and rural peers will develop.

       "  'counters': 'Actually suburban residents are more likely to exercise and have lower BMI than rural or urban residents. The suburbs have low crime rates and high access to amenities such as parks woodlands and athletic fields. They have better schools and are often safer to walk around in than other areas.

       "  'counters': 'As a privileged white man let me say I disagree with you. But not for the reasons you might suspect.First while I agree that you are not going to be able to find any foaming at the mouth KKK card carrying racist police officers anymore I do think there is a bias in the justice system to cut white people some more slack. There is also a bias to cut women more slack then men and a bias to cut attractive people more slack than uglies. You find me a pretty white woman who is actually in jail and ill find you ten ugly black men in jail who cumulatively have not done as much bad stuff as that one woman.So it is understandable that people want to protest our criminal justice system and see something like this as a good opportunity to do so. However I do think it is a more systemic expression because you are correct in that it is silly to protest this specific shooting until more facts are known.We have no idea what actually happened and until a couple of months have passed we are unlikely to have any idea. It is just as dumb to assume the cop acted rightly as to assume he acted poorly we have no evidence but our biases to base it on at this point. Once the facts come out it could well be that protests are warranted.'},\n",

I see in multiple news sources where people have stated that the footage appeared to cast aspersions on the dead man or is a form of character assassination. Finding out that the shooting victim had just returned from robbing a store is critical information because it provides context for the fact that a police officer confronted him over something minor and unrelated like obstructing the street and a violent altercation took place soon after. I see family members and other people saying that he wasnt perfect but it seems to me that theyre dismissing the fact that he had just committed a crime. The police officer may not have known of Michael Browns actions but it makes sense that Michael Brown would be more onedge scared and impulsive after committing a crime and encountering a police officer so soon after. Thus this footage provides a critical perspective into Michael Browns state of mind and his subsequent mannerismsbehavior might have alerted Officer Wilson and escalated the encounter.My view is that the CCTV footage was essential information that needed to be provided to the public. While it may have been misconstrued as character assassination the footage is an invaluable part of the story that helps explain the context and actions of both Officer Wilson and Michael Brown.',\n",

To see why people are so upset you have to look at the timing of the release and you have to look at what theyre still not doing. The community has a right to see the police report on the shooting the autopsy report and to know the shooters record. Instead after all this time the police have still released none of this information. What DID they find time to release? The one video that makes the victim look bad. If the police were releasing all the relevant information people wouldnt be upset. Instead they are holding back all information except the information that protects the shooter. This destroys any illusions that the local police are working for the victim.'},\n",

He was also found guilty of gang raping a woman in a hotel a crime for which he was sent to prison.With anybody else those three crimes would be enough to judge someone as an extremely violent and unsafe person highly unsuited to be a role model for anybody but for some reason hes earned a reputation for being some kinda hiphop gandhi.

He also had a lot of interveiws that better showed his true messages which were very profound.

       "  'titles': 'We should prohibit some people from possessing or consuming alcohol like we do with firearms',\n",
       "  'arguments': 'Note This is related to United States law but in theory it could apply to other places. I am specifically arguing this from a perspective of US law.There are various things that disqualify people from being allowed to purchase or possess firearms or ammunition. These generally include sometimes depending on state being involuntarily committed to a mental institution being the target of a restraining order being adjudicated by a court to be mentally unfit to stand trial being convicted of a violent misdemeanor or a domestic violence crime and being convicted of a felony.Most people seem to be perfectly happy with prohibiting some people from possessing firearms based on their history convictions mental illness etc. I believe we should be very careful with who we remove constitutionally protected rights from but I am ok with removing firearm rights through due process of law in most of the cases where we do under current law.My question is why do we not remove the privilege of people to possess and consume alcohol under certain circumstances? This isnt a constitutionally protected right and removal of that freedom would be done with due process anyway so there is no particular reason why we cannot do it.We should create a list of offenses that disqualify a person from being allowed to possess or consume alcohol. That list should include people with a DUI conviction that resulted in injury or death to an innocent person with a felony DUI conviction multiple DUIs in a short period DUI while on a suspended license etc people with a domestic violence or child endangerment conviction that was alcohol related and perhaps even people who have been involuntarily committed to a mental institution with suicidal tendencies.Alcohol consumption seems to increase risk of suicide in people who are already very depressed or suicidal it seems to increase the likelihood of domestic violence and child abuse and it definitely increases the risk of DUI in people with prior DUI convictions.In fact I have a friend with DUIs over a period of less than years while driving on a suspended license and yet they still eventually gave him his license back and he still drinks regularly and sometimes drives while under the influence. I think that is appalling just because he hasnt hurt anyone yet doesnt mean he should be allowed to keep drinking and driving until someone gets killed. His ability to legally possess and consume alcohol is a danger to society and simply suspending his license again isnt good enough he will still drive illegally even without a license.Here is how I would implement it. I think it is too much of a burden to require all bars and liquor stores to call up a system and run a background check on every patron like the current NICS system for firearms. Instead I propose that people who are deemed to be prohibited persons should have a special mark placed on their drivers license or ID which would indicate that they are prohibited. Bar tenders and liquor store employees would need to check everyones ID not just people who appear to be under age and would be required to refuse to sell alcohol to anyone with that mark on their license.Obviously that wont stop them from paying a homeless person to buy them alcohol like teenagers do so we also need strict penalties for prohibited persons who are caught with any alcohol in their blood or in their possession and even stricter penalties if they are caught committing any sort of crime while under the influence such as DUI domestic violence etc.This post was prompted by this thread but has also been something Ive been thinking about for a long timeTLDR Just like some people are deemed by society to be too irresponsible to be allowed to possess firearms due to criminal activity or mental illness some people potentially for different reasons should be deemed by society to be too irresponsible to be allowed to possess or consume alcohol and it should be a criminal offense for a prohibited person to possess or consume alcohol.',\n",
       "  'counters': 'I can think of a few people off the top of my head who were it the case that they were not allowed to consume any alcohol this means they cant enjoy a drink with their friends at their favourite bar on a friday night would probably sink deeper into despair than they already are. Alcohol is a social thing. What youre suggesting is to further ostracize already marginalized people. Many of the kinds of people who you suggest should be banned from consuming alcohol already struggle with fitting in integrating into society etc. Restricting them from a social act which virtually every normal person enjoys almost guarantees their continued social isolation. The difference with firearms is that they are not as ingrained into society and social interaction the way that alcohol is. If a person isnt allowed to buy a gun no one is even going to know. If a person has a mark on their license that prohibits them from enjoying a beer after work with coworkers everyone will know. And everyone will judge them exclude them etc. in a way that will make it extremely difficult for them to truly overcome their issues.'},\n",

I am completely pro choice but I dont like the way discussion in some cases takes place. For example I saw a post on two x that didnt really refute any restrictive abortion policies but just stated the right to bodily autonomy as an argument against them. I dont feel like stating that is a proper refutation. I think that if we were to look at something like sex selective abortion policies it might be more obvious what I see is wrong with those arguments. Imagine if they were having a debate in India. One person brings up all this data about the problems with unrestricted sex selective abortion and the other person simply said that those policies shouldnt be allowed because it was their right to an abortion for whatever reason they wish. This would be bad because the discussion is far too nuanced.I think that there are problems that arise from hiding behind this argument. The fundamental reason I would consider it bad is this. Rights are a human construct. A bunch of people got together and decided that guaranteeing certain rights would be best for the people. It seems perfectly reasonable that they couldve been wrong and that guaranteeing those rights in certain situation are bad. Not trying to suggest whether or not they are. They could be though so arguing that something shouldnt happen because it is your right is a terrible argument.Im not trying to suggest all discussion that takes place is like this. When talking about gun rights there is a lot of fruitful and important discussion using data statistics and other relevant factors.

Im not advocating for the abolition of the age of consent. I accept that the power differential and the immaturity of the younger person makes it problematic at the very least.Yet all the same I think its a great false equivalency to consider it to be a similar magnitude offense to being held down and raped. The primary reason I believe this and admittedly its based on little more than intuition is that I feel that victims of the respective crimes tend to feel much differently in hindsight. From what Ive read forcible rape victims often find the experience highly traumatic and suffer longterm psychological problems. Virtually all would agree that the experience was a huge negative. But I think if you were to poll a group of statutory rape victims years later when they were more mature you would get a much more diverse range of responses. Some would have no regrets and do the same thing over again some would regret it but chalk it up as a silly youthful mistake and others would blame it for a lot of their current problems. Probably the breakdown wouldnt look too different from polling them about any relationship theyd had while young.What would it take to change my view? Probably strong empirical evidence that statutory rape victims do by and large suffer significantly. I see that kind of thing asserted a lot but I kind of wonder if its a bit of justso story.

I read the statements of these kids and they dont even know proper terms for their genitalia they report feeling weird but its what their partner wanted so they went along with it all. Usually the perps are people who have a sort of control over them. When youre young those who are older than you who give you attention seem cool. Sometimes the age thing is intimidating because they know so much more. Instantly that person is given the control of the situation. Thats why things like this happen. The adults appeal to the kids give them stuff listen to their problems and whatnot. The kids feel cool being in a relationship with someone years their senior but they dont fully understand the situation. Theyre being manipulated in most cases. These kids havent even grown into their own personality. People at that age are going through so many changes and they just want to feel good. Sometimes people take advantage of that.Its upsetting to read these statements and see that these kids had no idea what they were doing.

Tenure is not needed by the definition Im to understand and it creates an unfair safety net when its not needed.Is it to keep the schools from firing the higher paid older teachers in favor of younger lower paid ones? Why is this the only federal job that does this if thats the case?',\n",
       "  'counters': 'Thats part of the reason but not the only one. Its also to protect due process and prevent firings for political reasons not related to job performance. For instance a teacher should not be fired for say failing a member of the school boards daughter or causing the schools star football player to get benched on academic probation. Thats not to say that those types of firings dont happen anyway but the teachers union reps job is to ensure that the firing is documented and a natural result of one of the four Isinsubordination immorality incompetence or insufficient certification.Its not. Many government employees receive career tenure as one of the benefits of working for a less competitive salary or in a field thats not a common commercial target but has significant government interest.From the Federal Employee Handbook on career tenurecareerconditional employee must complete three years of substantially continuous service before becoming a full career employee. This year period is used to determine whether or not the Government is able to offer the employee a career.Teachers are generally employees of the state but Im just illustrating that tenure for government employees isnt as unusual as you make it sound.The tenure system certainly has its flaws but I have yet to hear of an alternative that still protects teachers from being fired for reasons unrelated to job performance. Most jobs in most states are atwill meaning an employee can be fired for almost any reason at any time. It would be difficult to convince qualified people to work for often deplorable salaries without access to benefits commonly afforded to people who choose to work for the government. Being a teacher pretty much sucks and the politics in elementary and high school education can be utterly insane. Administrators and school board members often behave as petty dictators of tiny kingdoms and will try to fire people for all kinds of insane reasons. My dad was a teachers union rep and my mother was a teacher now both retired and Ive heard it all up to and including a principal would go out of his way to repeatedly document teachers for daring to drink coffee while teaching and teachers who would be placed on special assignment pending dismissal for getting divorced or having an affair. Firing someone for drinking coffee or screwing around on their husband during the personal time is just as much of a waste of taxpayer money as the sometimes overly extended hearings and negotiations involved in being fired for good cause.Of course we could just you know pay teachers more and allow them more autonomy so that the profession would attract more competitive and competent employees. Some states pay teachers quite well but others... hmm not so much Especially when you consider that many states if not all by now require teachers to have an advanced degree.'},\n",

So despite their efficiency they need much more power to provide good visibility than many other sources of light like fluorescent tubes. Even when the lights are replaced with modern LED lights most places opt for higher brightness instead of reduced power consumption. They are usually bright enough to disable night vision yet often not consistently bright enough for good day vision. This often makes it harder to see than with no artificial lighting at all especially if there are large gaps between the lights. While the eyes readapt faster from such relatively low intensity light there is still a period of a few minutes when you are effectively blind. I would not be surprised if it was a major cause of accidents. Many lampposts are designed and placed in such a way that its impossible to not look directly into the light which makes the above even worse.Instead if public lighting is to be provided at all it should be either cyan or white light limited to at most moonlight levels with possible exceptions for important signs and such and similar restrictions imposed on other sources of light like shop windows.

If so I would compare myself many times to the Popular kids at school and wonder why Im not so popular. I have good looks get good grades pretty sociable so where am I failing? But alas Im my own person. To try to compare my failings to the success of another would be ill advised because truly everyone is their own person.So its good to compare ourselves OP when we know we have reason to do it but bad taste to do so all the time without consideration for oneself.'},\n",

       "  'counters': 'There is one specific and special slightly dangerous possibility in comparing oneself to others.SPEAKING OF BOBLets say you have a friend Bob who is similar to you in some way. This could be music it could be physical strength or any number of things.Lets say you compare yourself to Bob in one or several ways. Maybe you have a similar level of income or a similar lack of employment or maybe you do similar things. Also lets say specifically that Bob is a little bit worse off than you maybe he doesnt make as much money or cant get a gig or isnt recognized for his musical talent.Lets say now that one day you wake up to find Bob got a job or got a raise at his job found a hot girlfriend got a record deal with BMIRCAwhatever and won the lottery. Additionally you happen to know that Bob is not very good at music and theyre just going to auto tune him that Bob is not very good at his job but his boss is his Uncle and that he probably plans to waste all his money in Vegas.At one point you may have felt a friendly competitive nature in relation to Bob and even prided yourself on the idea that you were ever so slightly better off than Bob or at least felt like he was someone helping you feel driven to succeed by making sure you were at least on a competitive level with him.But now things are quite different and its probably fair to say that all of a sudden you may now feel bad feelings instead of positive feelings. It may now seem unfair and impossible to accomplish anything in life and the friendly competitive drive may turn to depression and despair even though you yourself really have not changed.Sure this story is contrived and extreme but the result sooner or later of almost any type of self comparison situation is still pretty much the same or at least runs a high risk of seeing this type of outcome.While its important to be realistic about your skills and talents and improving them even a single small item in the area of how good at music you are in comparison to someone else can be a slippery slope leading to other implicit comparisons. If you start comparing yourself musically or skill wise to other people on a regular basis you will probably naturally begin to compare yourself on other levels and that can have irrational and devastating psychological consequences.WHAT ACTUALLY MATTERSIf the point of music is to cause pleasure in other humans which it probably is you really dont need the most technical skill out of everybody to provide a lot of value to other people. Id say playing fast which is probably one of the primary ways most musicians measure themselves is about the worst measure of the skill of a musician and that playing expressively is what counts.Of course its only natural to pursue advanced precision and speed if your desired occupation is musician but really there are far more important skills such as ability to compose to work on demand with others to take direction to learn charts to listen and read and fill in the gaps in a tasty manner without making things muddy or stepping on other peoples toes. As a musician myself I would always prefer to play with someone who can just listen and without me saying anything add something really groovy to the sound rather than someone who can play fast.You can use a metronome you can figure out how fast you can play and find your limits and set goals to improve them. You could take a general survey of how fast on average all the best players can play and then stop comparing yourself to anyone and instead set goals for yourself on where you want to go only in relation to yourself and a plain number in BPM rather than in comparison to any other specific people.Chances are youll never play as fast as Frank Gambale or Jan Hammer but you can probably play fast enough for any other person to think you can play as fast as you need to.Heck without even bothering to go watchlisten to other players you can probably already figure out a BPM target on your own. Or you could consult some complex classical scores by long since dead people to whom you cant really compare your persons but you can estimate how fast Rachmaninoffs compositions were intended to be played and then generate a rough goal for yourself in relation to yourself instead of in relation to other people.Theres also the issue of losing sight of why you like music in the first place what really moves you and when youve got a good firm hold on what you like and care about and want to hear and when you play what you want to hear and stop worrying about whether you sound like soandso then and only then youll be making the best music you can. Comparing yourself musically to other people is more or less inviting yourself to lose sight of yourself and what moves you to start believing that its only other people who can or do make good music and youll lose sight of your own passion and if you lose sight of that people probably wont like what you play very much regardless of how much skill you have.Watch this if you dont believe me on these last several paragraphs note this talk is applicable to anyone who plays any instrument and is more about general stuffMasterclass Mike WolffTLDR you really dont need to compare yourself to other musicians in order to know whether or not you are creating music that you like and that other people like. Much better would be to gauge peoples reactions to your music and how much they like it than to try to measure yourself in comparison to someone else. Much better would be to set reasonable personal goals based on what you already know about playing music and the difficulty involved and the skill level you wish to achieve but not in relation to others only yourself. Much better would be to study the sounds you hear that you like without reference to the people analyze why you like that what its made of and then incorporate it in to your own playing because you like it not because of an IMO misguided idea that that the person who played it is much better than you or that the person who played it played it fast.'},\n",

If you need to be on welfare because you cant afford food or housing then you should not be able to have children you wont be able to afford to feed and care for.

I am all for the people who get fired or laid off being able to get assistance and I wouldnt want to see anyones kids actually taken away so for those who asked about working mothers losing there jobs no they should definitely be able to keep their children. same goes for if they are pregnant when they apply. my biggest problem with the welfare system is when I see families with kids a PS putting big stereos in their new cars still collecting welfare and living that way for years. things like unemployment you are suppose to be looking for a job using the money till you get one. if your testing positive for the harder drugs chances are your not going to get a job seeing as most jobs drug check now. Thanks to KevinWestern about of my viewpoint has changed.

So its certainly fallible and i hope to be proven wrong in the near future.Id like for IS to be destroyed but i think thats an unrealistic expectation.This is a decent look at IS.They are well integrated into the areas they have captured. They are not universally hated by the surrounding civilians. They are not treating all civilians like prisoners or slaves or hostages. They have plenty of members recruits and sympathizers across enormous amounts of land.My view is that Civilian Blending is an unstoppable strategy designed to survive intervention from nations like the U.S.No individual country that respects or is bound by international law can defeat this strategy.Civilian Blending When a militant or terrorist group embeds into a civilian population in order to protect themselves from formal military retaliation. With successful use of this tactic there is minimal distinction visual or otherwise between the militants and the civilian people and infrastructure. its all shared space. militants are often near children and innocent civilians and live within the cities among the people.Goal To become as indistinguishable as possible from the civilian population to minimize the effectiveness of airstrikes and long range attacks.Tactics Dont wear uniforms store weapons in civilian areas such as Mosques Hospitals Schools vital infrastructure etc. Use residential civilian infrastructure like apartment buildings for militant activity use mass local propaganda and law enforcement to keep the civilians from fleeing recruit willing civilian martyrs encourage civilians to hide and assist militants for money use the inevitable civilian deaths to recruit more militants from the local population etc.Outcome Accurate recon becomes incredibly difficult and highly susceptible to errors. High civilian to militant death toll is inevitable in all types of operations. Major mistakes will also happen that result in mass civilian deaths. Extremely high value targets will be impossible to kill without killing innocent people in Mosques churches schools power plants water treatment plants and other vital infrastructure protected by international laws.This will leave the U.S. with very limited options...Option Contain them. Full victory is impossible without mass civilian deaths and breaking international laws. Let IS have what land they have already taken. Perhaps liberate small towns that overwhelmingly want to be liberated. Contain them and get into a prolonged conflicts along their borders. targeted airstrikes while we arm their neighbors to keep them from spreading.Option Fight them. Accept the civilian deaths. Eventually be stopped by the International community and accused of war crimes.The civilian blending tactic ensures that the international community will start to see warcrimes against civilians. Prolonged asymmetric warfare tends to makes the powerful side into the bad guy. The weak side just has to survive because it cant win. The US will kill innocent civilians in numerous ways by accident on purpose as acceptable losses and by killing the willing martyrs. Thats just war but it wont be accepted and the US will be condemned for each death deemed by the world as avoidable. There will be antiUS protests across the world. The media will begin to frame this as US vs innocent civilians. America will have to reexplain itself over and over. Why are you still there why isnt IS defeated yet? why did you bomb that school? Why is the civilian death count so high? Didnt we go in there to protect these people? But instead we bomb their kids?! The body count will be reported as IraqisSyrians dead mostly civilians US dead all soldiers. and people will discuss how evil the US is more and more every day. People will say If some invading force was on my land id shoot them too why is the US over there anyways? The civilian body count will be in the thousands or tens of thousands because this terrorist tactic works extremely well. People will quickly forget why the US is fighting in Iraq and accuse the US of indiscriminately targeting civilians. The US will be called on by the UN to explain why the civilian body count is so high. IS will wait patiently laughing its ass off because the big dumb animal fell into the trap AGAIN... The US will pull out because of the international and internal political pressure. IS will have an enormous recruiting tool from having survived a war against the US. Genocide land grabs sharia law ethnic cleansing suicide bombing assassinations kidnappings general violence and evil begins anew in Iraq and the US is called for to intervene.But maybe im wrong.Maybe this is what brings peace to that region.But personally i think IS hasis going to win.

My reason being is that I loved TV as a kid. It was my favorite thing to wake up in the morning to go see cartoons.Do I remember any of those cartoons? A bit yes.

       "  'arguments': 'In the wake of Robin Williams death theres been a lot of discussion in the community about depression which I think is great. The more awareness for what it is the better.I have a few viewpoints on this subject that I would like to get out there because its been bothering me.Little background Ive never been clinically diagnosed Ill get to why later but for the first years of college something weird happened. I went from having great grades in high school and a lot of friends to finding myself literally holing up in my dorm room every night and every weekend. I gained roughly pounds over those years and I was failing all my classes. I wasnt even able to muster the effort to put the work in. Also I distinctly remember having suicidal thoughts. I never actually thought I would go through with any of them but it occupied my mind quite a bit. I wanted to change. I desperately tried. But nothing was clicking. I definitely read a little bit into depression during this time and I figured that I had some minor variant of it. I wanted to reach out and talk to someone but I figured that I could handle it on my own. I read a lot into depression and overcoming it and I knew that exercise and a better diet would help but I still wasnt able to do any of that. Like I couldnt get myself to do what I know I needed to do. It pissed me off. I blamed myself for that and I still do. So heres where it gets interesting and heres where I hope some of you can shed light on this topic. This was almost years ago so Im forgetting exactly where the shift happened but the summer after my nd year I started reading a lot into Zen Buddhism and Stoicism and this COMPLETELY changed my view on the world and my life. What I realized was that my thoughts are in my head obviously and that I can be in control of them. I realized that I was putting positives and negatives into certain situations when the situation is neutral by default. The big thing for me was realizing that the world isnt mean or nice its indifferent. It literally gives no fucking shits about any of us. So I think what happened to me was that I had an expectation of reality that was different from reality itself. I believe this caused my year downward spiral to a point where I was an utter failure friendless and alone. This was definitely a ramble but I hope it made some sense. Im at a point in my life now where Im having a hard time remembering EXACTLY how I felt during that period but I definitely remember that I would sometimes cry in the shower and do other things of that nature. I was literally alone for days straight. I would just wake up and sit in my room the entire day. I would ask for extensions and still not be able to muster up any assignments.At the time I saw that as a character flaw and now I still see it as a character flaw. So does this mean that I see depression as a character flaw? I also learned that a lot of people go through similar bouts. Maybe not quite as intense rarely quite so intense...to the point where it is affecting your future but definitely something noticeable. So if I can get through it with reading books and changing my mental attitude why cant everyone else? Why cant we all realize that life isnt fun and games that its indifferent. Our thoughts CAN be controlled. I couldnt control them before but now I can. Its not an overnight process it took me about years to go from that fateful summer of meditation and Stoicism to where I am now. Im at a point now where I can objectively evaluate the things that are going on in my life and even if theyre bad I can handle it.So instead of popping pills and getting electric therapy why dont we medicate people with depression with books and meditation and a MENTAL SHIFT instead of a chemicallyinduced whateverapillis?BTW this same thing applies to anxiety. I went from having crippling anxiety to...still having crippling anxiety but its gotten better. I went from not being able to hold a conversation without panicking sweating almost crying to being able to hold conversations for as long as necessary. Again this all happened without meds. This happened with a mental shift that I induced through books and meditation.I guess Im wondering if someone can explain to me why the goto method is popping pills and therapy when I know for a fact that you can bootstrap your own healing? Im not saying to man up or buck up Im saying to realize that its all in your head and that you dont have to be a slave to it. Meditation and selfhelp books helped me with that a lot.TLDR Pills are unnecessary for depression and anxiety. Theyre just character flaws that can be changed with practice.

If you only by Apple products and only use them the way Apple intends I can pretty much guarantee you that you will never have an issue. The Apple OS functions like a copy of Windows that has been locked down by a savy network administrator who doesnt trust his users not to break things.In my experience there is a continuum in the computing world with Apple on one end and Linux on the other.With Apple your options are limited as are you ability to fix things however you dont have to do much of anything to get a standard config to work but you really cant setup things in a nonstandard way.With Microsoft you have alot of options and a pretty good ability to fix things. You dont have to do much to get a standard config to work. While you can get a nonstandard config to work you can also break things pretty bad trying to and it will take alot of effort.With Linux you have every option open and the ability to fix anything. You have to do a decent amount of work to get a standard config to work but you can get any crazy non standard config to work if you want assuming time and a actual viable config. However you have to do everything down to coding your own kernel from time to time.So the question is how much time do you want to spend working on your computer to get it to do the things you want? Would you rather conform and use the easiest thing available in the easiest way? Would you rather spend a little time working and understanding things for more freedom? Or do you want to have to understand how bootstrap loading and driver injections works just so you can get to a desktop?I the end I dont use apple products. I hate how restricted I feel when I work on them. While I do Linux work for my job I dont use it at home because it isnt worth the effort to me. Windows is where I fit. But I know a system admin in his s who does linux programing all day at work who cant be bothered to deal with even windows glitches at home when he could just pay a little extra and have his MAC. The director of our IT department uses a MAC at home because he can afford to. In the end if someone wants to pay a premium to have things work the way they want without extra work that is just their priority.'},\n",

The reason why Im posting this so late is because I wanted to confirm a few things with some people before I said anything here.In our country theres a test you can do that allows you to predict whether your unborn child will be born with Downs Syndrome or not and being typical parents we took the test thinking that any child born with a disability would be detrimental to society and should be aborted. weeks later and the test says that she has a in chance of having Downs Syndrome. Thinking that we dodged a bullet we proceed with the birth and months later my wife gives birth to a beautiful baby girl. Within an hour we noticed that something wasnt right. She wasnt drinking anything she did drink was thrown back up wasnt responding to stimuli and had an extremely low muscletone. By day theyd discovered that she had a blockage in her bowel and had to be flown to another city for surgery. weeks after she was born let it be known that she hasnt had her surgery yet because the surgeons here thought that our backwater pediatric surgeon doesnt know shit but then get shot down when we prove those mofos wrong! we get called aside and informed that she has Downs Syndrome. That doctor then gets a call while shes with us that she has a hole in her heart so large that they were surprised that she was still alive asd mm vsd mm and we had to delay the surgery.We lost times that day. . Our daughter who hadnt had any form of nourishment for the first weeks had to wait another week for life saving surgery.. The daughter we thought we were going to have died that day and was replaced by one we didnt think we wanted. There was a chance that the one we did have was going to die of heart failureRegardless of the loss we went ahead and tried to be parents to this new child we had in front of us. We werent supposed to touch her at this point in time but they let us hold her. As we held her both my wife and I cried. I dont know what my wife cried about but I cried for the daughter I lost the daughter I was hoping to have and the future we were going to live through. I still went and visited her and was as supportive as I could to my wife but this was a new child and it felt like I was just visiting a random kid. weeks and surgery later...I had plenty of annual leave owing to me so I stayed back and my wife went home and looked after the other kids. Some of you may think that this was a terrible idea since I had no love for this child... it ended up being the best thing to allow me to bond with her. As long as I was wearing scrubs and was following protocol with cleanliness I was allowed to look after her. I changed her wiped her eyes cleaned her assisted the nurse with any of my daughters needs. Alongside this I was also there for her milestones. Not the ones normal babies have the little ones that we all take for granted her first mls mls mls of milk. her first stool the first time she swallows milk her first cry for food when we know we can feed her her first day of not being assisted by intravenous nutrition the first day we can hold her with no tubes. By the time she got to go home I had completely fallen in love with my daughter again. The thing is though is that I loved her far more than what I thought was possible. This kid was a fighter too she has managed to be in thousand live without nourishment for weeks without actual food for another and has brutally smashed every milestone she puts infront of herself. At years old she has worked out how to turn on the TV and switch on her favorite cartoons she has worked out the passwords on both my wifes laptop and all the tablets in the house recently she has managed to work out how to use speed dial on the phone and now I get the occasional call from her saying Dad I want biscuits Dad I want Peppa Pig Dad come home. But this isnt what makes her so amazing. What makes her amazing is that she inspires others. Both of my sisters were in dead end jobs and have both decided to follow their dreams. one became a restaurant reviewer and the other is now working towards becoming the manager of a hotel.

       "  'arguments': 'In the most recent Ninja Turtles movie theres a scene where one of the main villains has one of his henchmen a Foot Clan soldier killed to prove the efficacy of a weapon while being held down by two other Foot Clan soldiers. Darth Vader is also guilty of this routinely killing Imperial officers. So does the Joker in the Dark Knight and this actually almost goes wrong for him. All three of these examples represent slightly different reasons for killing your henchmen but I think each one is poor form. In the case of the Ninja Turtles villain actions like that engender dissent and create a culture of fear and paranoia among your henchmen. I mean those guys just had to hold down their coworker and watch him die how do they know its not going to be them next time? If anything would inspire me to quit or revolt that would definitely be up there.In the case of Darth Vader he kills Imperial officers for failing him which stifles creativity and likely costs him a lot of high quality officers. The Empire is fighting an insurgency and as recent events in Afghanistan showed mistakes are going to be made and its difficult work. I suspect that the reason Vader is constantly saddled with incompetent officers is that he killed all the competent ones long ago and now no one wants to work with him. Also the Empire clearly doesnt promote based on merit because Vader immediately promotes a guy after the first time we see him kill someone and that guy sucked just as much.In the case of the Joker his plan almost backfires as its happening. You think when the Joker gets back to his JokerCave none of his countless other henchmen are going to be like Hey wheres Vinny and Don and Jake? Didnt they go to rob that bank with you? The Joker treats all of his henchmen as completely disposable and useless which is likely how he sees them but thats bad for morale. Its not like theres a shortage of villains hiring random thugs for stuff in Gotham. Go seek a job where your employer isnt a constant source of danger.Machiavelli said that if you cant be loved and feared its better to be feared but he touted Cesare Borgia as a great leader and that guy died naked and alone of a stab wound. The only case where I think killing your henchmen makes sense is shooting deserters in the middle of a pitched battle as that encourages continued fighting in the moment over desertion in an over the top kinda situation. Otherwise its bad for business and lowers morale. There are better ways to handle all these situations.',\n",
       "  'counters': 'It is important to realize that there are multiple sources of power. The most obvious are the transactional powers of Reward and Punishment. When it comes to these power its not the absolute amount of reward or punishment but the relative amount. This was amply demonstrated by the German occupation of Belgium a century ago at the beginning of World War One. They hauled the entire populations of villages out of bed and shot them systemically destroyed landmarks and irreplaceable libraries and warned the remainder sternly to not take up arms. The point was to punish everyone severely enough that it would be unnecessary to garrison the area freeing up more troops for the attack on Paris. It was also demonstrated by the collapse of occupation regimes who are unable or unwilling to resort to repression and violence. Rather successful use of these transactional powers depend entirely on the spread between reward and punishment. You know treating people really well to reward and really bad to punish. The problem stems from when you already treat people generally well or badly.Lets say you treat your minions badly already. In that case even small rewards are very effective but punishments tend to be lost amid the general crappy treatment. There are few methods for effective punishment in that scenario and punishment is absolutely necessary. I would argue that these cases should not be taken as occurring in a vacuum. This indicates that things like casual torture demotions and the like are meted out for relatively minor offenses and the manager on scene has little recourse but go for the big one. After all if you are simply demoted for a campaigncrippling error and that is the same penalty as showing up out of uniform during inspection that indicates that you consider those two events roughly equal. If you get lashes for an unkempt bunk and also for letting the hero escape the brig then that pirate captain wont be captain for long because he obviously isnt taking this seriously.How you organize and deploy this power over your underlings is inherently strategic. You play to your strengths to maximize control. The problem for Darth Vader is that these things are the choice of Emperor and he needs to play enforcer in a situation of absurd discipline. He needs to win with only a handful of tools to punish and the Emperor jogging his arm with the need of political orthodoxy we dont see the competent Imperial Officers because they represent a threat to the Emperor and are therefore kept dealing with equally important but less politically sensitive problems. In the case of the Shredder he is stepping into a heritage and tradition of cruelty previous masters set a tone and the resetting of the balance between reward and punishment would threaten his legitimacy power as successor. What good it is to get a little more power and control over a specific transaction if you sacrifice a powerful and functionally free source of authority? He is also stuck with very few methods of punishment that underlines the severity of failure to the whole clan.The Joker is possibly your best example but is also insane. I think his killing of underlings is more to underline his villainous street cred in the minds of readers than any purpose in story.I would argue that over the long term and with a completely secure base you would be correct that there would be better answers to all of these problems. I would also argue that these villains and minions exist within an established dynamic that takes most if not all of those better answers off the table. Failing to punish failure is not acceptable. Using a comparatively minor punishment is even worse than failing to punish at all. This only leaves excessive or fiendishly inventive punishments and given that punishment is only effective in a short window after the event in question the apparently simplest excessive punishment is the optimal solution without endangering the whole operation by diverting planning and resources to punish failure.'},\n",

I just found this subreddit tonight as I was thinking about a lot of opinion topics so I thought it would be a good time to express this opinion of mine. Disclaimer Im neither a vegan nor a vegetarian.I understand that many vegetarians abstain from meat because they feel morally guilty or they feel that it is wrong to kill animals for food. I suppose that some vegetarians may just not want to take part in eating meat themselves and dont really care about the bigger picture but that seems like a shallow and pointless reason to be a vegetarian to me. While meateaters dont actively kill the animals themselves by eating them they support the slaughterhouses and farms that do kill the animals for food production by continuing to consume meat. If meat is demanded it will be supplied and vegetarians aim to reduce the demand. This to me seems like a much more legitimate purpose and reasoning for being vegetarian. This same philosophy compels people to vote in democratic governments. Even if they are only one person it takes many individuals to come together to elect representatives. This is the most valid argument that I can think of in favor of moral vegetarianism.This philosophy is all fine and good but vegetarians alone will not and cannot fulfill this goal by virtue of not being vegans. As long as dairy products and eggs are consumed there is still a need for dairy cows and egglaying chickens. When the cows no longer produce milk and the chickens no longer lay eggs what do you think happens to them? Generally they are turned into meat for human consumption. Vegetarians drink milk and eat cheese that comes from cows that get slaughtered. The only way to lessen meat production is to reduce the number of people with any kind of need or want for animal products. Maybe Im wrong about what vegetarians aim to accomplish exactly. Any ideas?',\n",

If I truly lived to my own moral standards I would be giving far more to the needy living more frugally using my free time to be politically active in causes I believed in etc etc. Instead I do what I can and accept I am not perfect.

Because they tend to be quit tightknit communities they can become very hostile to outsiders very racist for example.

Farming is king if that means they have to spray that pesticide that may get into the food chain and water fuck it they need their crops. Cull the badgers and the foxes etc etc. I think in a way the increased space allows for that sort of thinking. In cities theres so little green space that any negative thing is quite clear thats why small parks can end up looking awful really quickly. But it also motivates people more because thats all they have. Whereas in the countryside who cares if theres a load of trash in that bit of the forest theres loads more. Im only spraying this on one field look around at all the others etc. I think like another commenter said you get more variety in people in cities. The social values are also more subtle. Its the not running the brown family out of town value rather than the come on in neighbour I just made cookies value. And the environmental values are often more nebulous since in a city you cant alter farming practices you cant put solar panels in an apartment etc and micro riding a bike cleaning the nearby park having a window garden.

Somehow a year old man was able to make a year old boy appreciate living as an adult without losing your inner child.As I grew older I experienced Robin Williams through an ever evolving lens seeing many of his films out of order from their production.I watched a child struggle with both being different and facing mortality in Jack.I watched a man willing to tempt fate and the law in a struggle to keep his family together in Mrs Doubtfire.I watched a man pour his heart out to a young slacker to try and get him to embrace life and potential in Good Will Hunting.I watched a man try to keep joy in the life of others even when the joy is ripped from his own life in Patch Adams.I watched a man literally go through Hell to reunite a family in What Dreams May Come.I watched a man turn to rage upon losing everything and step back from it in Death to SmoochyI watched a man try to balance keeping the morale of troops high while staying within the rules in Good Morning VietnamI watched a man struggling and failing to keep his world intact after losing his wife in a mindless crime in The Fisher KingI experienced the depth that just a voice could give in his animated works particularly Aladdin and Ferngully.And perhaps most fitting I watched a man use poetry to reach out to group of students and get them to embrace literature and life in The Dead Poets Society.Robin Williams showed me some of the highest of highs and lowest of lows possible in life while always keeping a slice of hope and a glint of humor alive.Robin Williams was a man whose entire lifes work consisted of connecting with each and every one of us. The outpouring of emotion you are seeing tonight is a testament to his success as an artist.The emotion is real. The responses are real. If you arent feeling it thats OK. But for many of us it is real. Please dont try and marginalize our feelings because you dont understand.'},\n",

How many times do you turn on your phones screen to archive a dumb email or read a oneline message or acknowledge an event etc.? Every time you do that it hits your battery. With a smart watch you can take care of all that on your wrist with a finger swipe and leave your phone comfortably on standby.

Thats solely due to my use of my smartwatch normal usage without the watch would give it less than a day.Driving. When youre driving and you want to call someone or get directions youre in a bit of a bind. Yes OK Google can get you through that now but for most phones that requires getting your hand on the phone waking it up and getting it in some kind of state where its ready for voice commands some make this easy some hard. This is inconvenient in a car and possibly dangerous. With a smartwatch you can just flick your wrist forward waking up the watch and OK Google immediately.Silence. I am frequently in meetings and on conference calls where I cant risk my phone making noise while at the same time I really need to know if certain emails or messages come in. This is a hard problem with just a phone I can put the phone on vibrate but in my pocket I may not feel it and Id have to continually take it in and out of my pocket distracting on a call and rude in a meeting. But if I place the phone on the table vibrate will make as much noise as the ringer would. These problems are solved by the smartwatch I can leave the phone on silent and the watch will notify me.Silence all the time. In fact I can just leave my phone on silent all the time. This is a huge win too since it means I dont have to worry about remembering to set my phone on vibratesilent I never accidentally make noise in a meeting or theater because my phone never needs to get my attention thats what the watch is for.Confidence. This touches all the points above. If my phones on silent by accident or design and I need to see emails or messages I need to know if the phone has notifications. Some phones most? have LEDs which blink but what if its off when you look at it instead of on? So you have to sit there and stare at the phone and then even if it does blink it still might be another newsletter from Newegg. With a smartwatch I can glance at the screen and as soon as I look at it I will know if I have a notification and if so what it is and who its from.I could probably carry on like this for a while but these are my experiences.

It always works for me Dakota to Decatur uh huhThis part is really questionable. It sounds like he is getting her high in addition to being wasted and blasted as he refers to in the chorus potentially without telling her what he is giving her first. Hey hey heyCause now you winningHey hey heyHeres our beginningImmediately after giving her weed maybe without her knowing what she is smoking he says heres our beginning which seems to say hes decided to ignore the blurred lines and initiate sex.

Lately terming yourself the nice guy gets you a lot of flak because some how its been attributed an extremely negative connotation.

It assumes that their actions are purely manipulative and that they expect an actionreward sort of relationship out of people.

They are the ones that are sure to be quick and helpful about repaying a favor when someone does them a kindness. These people arent morons thoughthey dont assume sexual attraction to be a favor as popculture would tell you. The issue at play is that they are not exactly socially wellrounded so when they become involved with a girl in a platonic manner emotional attachment comes easily and quickly. This attachment only grows as the girl sees them as a closer friend because of how much time they spend together and how many favors the guy is willing to perform for them the notorious such a great friend line. Meanwhile because of the nature of attraction the mans constant desire to please is sure to seat him in the also highly stigmatized friendzone.So the situation that arises is the man unawares finds himself with a woman whom he thought a strong bond of companionship and mutual feelings was blossoming when in fact she has not the slightest romantic interest in him.The man isnt expecting to hit a favor quota and receive the adoration of his adoredhe is simply deluded into the idea that the more time he spends with her the more she will realize or have the chance to realize that he is the one she has truly loved all along. Generalizing him as an asshole who is only interested in women for sex wont help him shake his fairy tale mindset. People assume he only had sexual interests from the start which I dont believe is true. They then instantly shame him for even having those interests which only furthers the problem.

Is nice guy behaviour a bad thing or when is it bad?What is the stereotypical nice guy behaviour?The behaviour is inextricably linked with romantic and sexual relations and this is when things take a turn for the worse. Do nice things and hope people notice it and enter into a romantic or sexual relationship with them. However this is a terrible way of looking at human relations. A relationship is not an endgame. It is a bad pattern of behaviour to treat it as such and that should not be encouraged. I think most people are nice and have expectations of others. I have unsaid expectations of others. Primarily if someone is my friend I expect reciprocity in the relationship. I will not take advantage of anyone and I expect not to be taken advantage of. However a relationship is defined by more than one party and from what I have come to understand of the stereotype the unsaid expectations are unreasonable and what might be reasonable said expectations are left unsaid and any confusion about these expectations are left unresolved. And these expectations are part of ANY relationship. A parentchild relationship friends lovers and more. I love people and I think it is the right thing to do to be nice to them. However I also own up to the consequences of my behaviour or at least try to try to be clear about relationship dynamics and try to inform people of my expectations of them. The stereotypical nice guy behaviour does not extend the courtesy of informing other people of their expectations and instead expects the other participants to behave in a way conducive to the nice guys ends. When people are the stereotypical nice guy in a relationship with expectations of romance they somehow believe that this is the default mode of reciprocity and there is no other way to maintain an equitable relationship.When youre this kind of nice guy you damage not only your romantic relationships but your other ones as well. What will you do tomorrow when you are attracted to someone other than your SO? What will you do when you feel like you shouldnt get into a relationship but find out someone youre into is into you?If youre this kind of nice guy youre not a nice guy at all regardless of your intentions. Im not speaking here of how other people should treat you but how youone not you OP but the general youone ought to treat other people. Whether this stereotype is actually common in people or not is not something I know enough or wish to answer. However I have tried to demonstrate why this stereotype is bad behaviour.

Even if youre a fluent speaker of two languages you might not be culturally fluent enough to pick up on all of the little nuances.

A good translationlocalization will convert those nuances to something that will be more familiar to you. Out of the TV series you mentioned Ive only seen GoT but I imagine that shows with more modern settings would benefit more from localization.Of course good translation and dubbing are complicated and expensive procedures. Im not sure how it works in Germany but in the US there tend to be two kinds of dubs the kind where all of the roles are dubbed by professional voiceover artists and the kind where most of the main roles are dubbed by wellknown Englishspeaking actors who usually dont have much experience doing voiceover work. The dubs that use professional voiceover actors usually sound better. Theres a real art to voiceover acting whether its for a dub of a foreign production or the original of an animated production. Because all of the actors are recorded in separate sound booths often at different times it takes a lot of skill from both the actors and the director to blend them into naturalsounding dialogue. Anything that has to be rererecorded because it just doesnt sound right costs money and often the budget for rerecording just isnt there. Thats why lowbudget dubs and cheap animation usually sound so unnatural.

Level has been asking for Verizon to allow them to connect the other ports therefore doubling the size of the link in order to alleviate the congestion.Verizon refuses to do so unless Level pays them.But here is the rub.

The idea of net neutrality is to make the pipes of the internet neutral to allow for innovation on the side of content not delivery. To allow things like netflix and youtube and facebook to startup.

I believe that democracy has been sustainable in the United States because the majority of people were smart enough to elect leaders who had the best interests of the people and the country. However looking at birth rates demographics education levels income levels and so on... its becoming more amp more clear that the majority will soon become uneducated people. Let me be clear here by uneducated I mean people who cannot understand what is actually best for them and the country. If democracy continues to exist there is no defense against dumb people electing leadership that will ruin the country. These dumb people will have a greater say then the smart people and as a result will eventually cause the demise of democracy. Take Gaza for example. Hamas was democratically elected. Now to a levelheaded person they probably wouldnt want to elect a political party that is willing to sacrifice its own people to fulfill a political agenda. However in Gaza the majority of the people voted for Hamas and as a result they were elected. To me this is an example of democracy failing. When leadership that destroys its country is elected by a majority of people who believe said leadership is best for them simply because they are not educated or wise enough to understand the consequences of the leadership that they elected. This is just one example. I believe that in order for society to evolveexist we cannot put our faith in the people. I believe that we must be ruled by the elites of our societies.

       "  'counters': 'I wrote an essay on this topic last week in my political science class. Received a on it. Your concerns are the exact same concerns the framers had when they wrote the constitution. The short answer is that through the Madisonian model we are already mostly ruled by the elites. The long answer is belowAs the framers constructed the new Constitution in Philadelphia the fear of a tyrannical majority and wariness about the stability of direct democracy resulted in the search for a distribution of political power that balanced democracy with elitism. The end result was a new federal government composed of institutional mechanisms that allowed a spirit of direct democracy but not the same exact composition satisfying the interests of the elites for stability and the interests of the lower classes for a voice of representation. The framers were not inherently against state rights. Their fear of the tyrannical majority was a rational reaction to the convoluted state politics of the s. As the newly liberated state legislatures celebrated their freedom after the Revolutionary War officials elected to the state legislatures often came from lower class background and possessed relatively little education. Secondly these legislators served only oneyear terms and so there was little compelling reason for them to learn the intricacies of government or to design new public policies that solved longterm problems. Thus these legislators frequently enacted shortsighted and unjust laws that only benefited their local constituents. For example many state paper money acts were passed that while benefitting local constituents in the short term hurt creditor groups and the broader state economies in the long term. As time passed it became clear to the nations leaders that these state legislators were merely spokesmen for their constituents and either not interested or not aware of the interests and needs of their state as a whole. In response to this unsettling development Thomas Jefferson wrote Despots is as oppressive as one. An elected despotism was not the government we fought for. This mismanagement of the state economies by the selfinterested legislatures caused the economic depression that had started after the Revolutionary War to intensify sending much of the lower class into bankruptcy. In Massachusetts bankrupt farmers demanded the suspension of debtor prosecution when they were not able to pay back the merchants in gold. When their demands were ignored Daniel Shays a former captain in the Continental army led one thousand farmers to the Massachusetts Supreme Court. Shays Rebellion was the final proof to the framers that the greatest threat to the stability of the new nation was not a tyrannical executive from the elite but a tyrannical lower class majority. In the s there was only one known type of democracy simple direct bythepeople forthepeople democracy. However it was this type of democracy where the laws and future of a nation are determined by the simple majority that had resulted in such ineffective governance in the state legislatures. If the framers constructed a national government based on this same direct democracy they feared that in time the popular class would enact laws that benefited themselves but not the elites. Additionally the framers worried that the instability of direct democracy would eventually ruin the nation. James Madison noted the turbulent democracies in ancient Greece and modern Italy and pinpointed the source of their instability to be factions. Then noting that since factions are an inevitable consequence of liberty and since liberty is a requirement of democracy Madison argued that direct democracies are inherently instable. Thus while the framers sincerely wanted a democratic form of government direct democracy posed too great a risk to their elite class and to the stability of the nation as a whole. To create a democratic government that did not result in tyranny or instability institutional mechanisms needed to be created that had the spirit of direct democracy but not the same exact composition. In Federalist Paper James Madison wrote To secure the public good and private rights against the danger of such a faction and at the same time preserve the spirit and form of popular government is then the great object to which are inquiries are directed. The Framers goal was to form a government that had the tools to appease and control the factions thereby protecting the longterm interests of the nation and the elites. In Federalist Paper James Madison presented his answer to this quandary In framing a government which is to be administered by men over men the great difficulty lies in this you must first enable the government to control the governed and in the next place oblige it to control itself. A dependence on the people is no doubt the primary control on the government but experience has taught mankind the necessity of auxiliary precautions. The auxiliary precautions that Madison identified as so crucial to enabling the government to control itself are today known as Separation of Powers Checks and Balances and Federalism. These political elements now cumulatively known as the Madisonian Model would become the defining characteristics of the new federal government and their interlocking strength would protect it from the attacks of tyranny and factions till the present day. Through the strict separation of powers within the federal government and between the federal and state governments a more limited form of democracy was born. Thus the Madisonian Model was the key to combining the interests of the elites with democracy in a distribution of political power agreeable to all. The first element of the Madisonian Model is the separation of the legislative judicial and executive powers into separate branches. This separation of powers prevents the political ideology of a temporary majority from quickly infiltrating the entire federal government. The legislature is divided into the house of representative and the senate which was originally elected by the house but today is also elected by the people. The house serves terms of two years while the senate serves sixyear terms. This difference in term limits gives the Senate a more distant perspective on politics and government allowing them to propose laws that benefit the longterm future of the nation while ignoring temporarily angered constituents. The executive branch contains the president who is elected for one to two fouryear terms. The judicial branch contains the nine judges of the Supreme Court who are appointed by the president for life terms. Together these three branches of political power operate in a system of checks and balances to ensure the federal government produces stable and smooth governance no matter the size or power of majority factions. The Checks and Balance system is the second element of the Madisonian Model and it defines the relationships and the rules of behavior between the three separate branches of the federal government. These checks and balances further weaken the influence of temporary majority factions on the federal government by giving a branch the power to negate decisions or change the salaries and budgets of another branch that may have become too inclined to an ideology. For example the legislative branch has the power to confirm and set the salaries and budgets of all federal judges pass legislation set the federal budget and impeach a president. The judicial branch has the power to declare executive orders and legislative laws unconstitutional. The executive branch has the power to nominate federal judges and veto legislation. In addition the powerful process of amending the constitution requires the intricate cooperation of all three branches. Madison called this system of checks and balances the best defense against agrarian attempts to overthrow the government because without these checks and balances the separate branches would surely be overtaken by factions that refused to cooperate with the other branches of government.The third element of the Madisonian Model is Federalism which is where both the federal government and state governments exist at the same time in the same place exerting their own unique sovereign power. With Federalism the federal government controls foreign policy regulates interstate commerce and promotes uniform standards of trade while the sovereignty of the states is preserved in all areas not specifically relegated to the authority of the federal government. Federalism is advantageous for the lower classes and majority factions because it gives more autonomy to the states and more chances for political participation by citizens. For example when AfricanAmericans were repeatedly denied their civil rights by southern courts and juries the civil rights movement was able to successfully restate their appeals for justice in the federal courts. Federalisms drawback however was that it increased government duplication and complexity creating an environment prone to legal disputes. Nonetheless Federalism is also advantageous and vital to the elites because it allows the lower class factions to shape state governments to reflect their own colorful or temporary interests allowing the federal government and the elites interests to remain relatively insulated. Thus through the Madisonian Model the framers were able to create a new type of democratic government that balanced the interests of the elites with the interests of the lower classes. The Madisonian models ingenious ability to let the elites maintain control while still providing a legitimate voice to the lower classes has led to it serving as a model for democratic governments around the world for over years. Thus since their incorporation into a single political element in the three concepts of Separation of Powers Checks and Balances and Federalism have changed our world immeasurably.'},\n",

Your is talking about the affect on the server.In American culture tipping of about is considered normal at sitdown restaurants. When you leave a tip you are communicating to your server. A higher than normal tip is a complement a lower than normal tip is an insult. Think about how you feel when you receive a compliment or an insult.

Fight the same enemy times and you can. Cant beat these enemies? Go a few screens back and fight the enemies there times until youre strong enough to proceed. Most RPGs can get away with this by having some major strategy in the battle system or wonderful storytelling. The closest thing Pokemon has to this is its type weaknesses most of which are obvious Fire is weak to water. Even the ones that arent obvious can only be discovered by trial and error and still dont add a huge amount of strategy to the game.Imagine a new player about to reach Giovanni for the first time in the last gym. Oh the next boss uses ground Pokemon? Let me just throw everything at it until I see what theyre weak to. Water and grass? Let me fight the same Pokemon times until Im strong enough to fight them and win. The best case scenario without grinding is to hope the RNG is on your side which still seems like incredibly boring gameplay.Granted mikalaranda already changed my view so soon so unless you have something new to add I suggest you look at his response. It was perfect I think.',\n",
       "  'counters': 'I agree with you I wouldnt say that the battle system or the storytelling are the selling points of Pokemon. Battles are fun and the stories can be entertaining but I personally wouldnt argue that these are what have led the series to its immense international popularity. I would say some of the strongest points of the series are the following The joys and wonders of finding new Pokemon This appeals to so many things that people find enjoyable adventure discovery exploration collecting. Even after having encountered all the species of Pokemon that exist in the game people still have fun searching for Pokemon with certain stats. attributes genders or colors. Because of how rare and difficult to obtain some of these Pokemon are trainers always have new adventures that they get to undertake in the form of hunting these more elusive creatures. Virtual Pets Unlike other RPGs where you are taking control of humans in Pokemon you get to control a team of cool cute funny lovable monsters! Pokemon in a sense gives you the opportunity to have those dogs cats birds and hamsters that youve always wanted but never had because either your parents wouldnt let you you dont want to put up with the hassle of taking care of them or you just dont trust yourself with a real living creature. Except in Pokemon those pets breath fire shoot streams of pressurized water and hurl bolts of lightning at each other all at your command.So I would just say that it isnt valid to say Pokemon has no appeal because it is lacking in what are admittedly its weakest aspects. Every game is lacking in some way or another but what makes it fun is how well its strong points make up for this.'},\n",

       "  'counters': 'Alright Im a pretty hardcore Stormcloak guy so lets get this going. First things first we both recognize that the goal of both Imperial and Stormcloak is to destroy or at least heavily damage the Aldmeri Dominion to the point where they cant be aggressive so I wont waste time establishing that. And we both consider the political and final outcome in that regard to be more important than freedom of religion in skyrim that the rebellion should be practical rather than principled. The Empire has demonstrated within recent history that they are willing to cede territory to the Thalmor. Look at what happened at Hammerfell because of the Whitegold Concordat. With this in mind theres no reason to suppose that the Nords would feel safer under the rule of the empire.And about Hammerfell they successfully proved that the Altmer can be bled so much during an invasion that they will give up. If Skyrim were to successfully cecede theres little reason to think that these nations wouldnt provide aid to one another. Now the Aldmeri Dominion may have more might than either Hammerfell or Skyrim possibly even both but the successes it experiences are likely to be too costly to be worth it.Thats the positive military argument for secession now lets look at the negative one. The Altmer live for a very long time and reproduce very slowly the common thought is that the empire will end the ceasefire in another human generation or so and destroy the weakened elven army but this is a very narrow point of view that misses several factors in my opinion. This assumes that Thalmor propaganda fails to make the new generation peaceable. It assumes that the Khajiit who are very allied with the Thalmor and very capable warriors will not join the fight. And lastly it assumes that the Thalmor are so stupid that they didnt realize this and just chose to end the war short of annihilating the empire because they thought true peace was possible. This is ridiculous. They have a plan and based on the obvious lack of insight that the empire has as to what this plan is and how to counteract it continuing under their guidance is very foolish. Ulfric killing Torygg is definitely a bad thing no argument here but is it worse than what the Empire is selling? The empires very existence is a display of Might makes Right. Skyrim became a part of the empire with the beginnings of the Septim Dynasty to follow a Dragonborn. Once Martin dies so to do the terms of their agreement. The Empires entire claim to Skyrim is We can make you. Skyrim went along with this because the costs of secession outweighed the benefits when the appraisal is made that this is no longer the case the Empire loses its legal leverage and now only has an army for its claim. Now as for the killing itself I find it very important to consider one aspect which is that it was a challenge. The in game text seems to support the idea that Torygg could have denied the challenge and lost honor but not the throne. This idea is floated again by Proventus Avenicii Thalmor party lover when talking to Jarl Balgruuf. With a common enemy I see little reason for the Jarls to engage in infighting after driving out the Imperials. Now for some original points you may not have considered. First and foremost the PC is the goddamn Last DragonBorn. The LDB has IMMENSE power. They couldnt conquer the Summerset Isles on their own but with an army at their back it wouldnt even be a challenge. The Stormcloack army with possible Redguard support could tear the heart of the Aldmeri Dominion out very quickly if led by the LDB. The Empire is unlikely to give the kind of military support necessary though preferring instead their own might and likely viewing the LDB as a political threat. Dont forget that the Empire was initially formed by such a being.This other point ties back in to the first one but is a little out there. What is the goal of the Thalmor? The short answer to unmake creation. Talos worship isnt about worshiping a man who became a god its about the mythopoeic power that this worship has and its role in holding the stability of creation. Think about the Thalmor advisor in the College of Winterhold he wasnt acting alone out of insanity. The Thalmor view is that creation is a mistake and they want to go back to being Anuic souls. This ceasefire with the empire gives them enough leeway and free passage to go around investing and destroying the towers and that absolutely cant be allowed to continue for the decades required for the empire to build up its forces.'},\n",

       "  'counters': 'As you have acknowledged the Aldmeri Dominion is the true threat not just to Skyrim but to the world but your belief in the Empires ability to meet that threat as it currently stands seems unsupported. The Empire has already been beaten their continued existence is due to last minute heroics and the cost of most of their autonomy. Aldmeri agents operate openly within the Empires borders the people of the Empire face restrictions on their freedoms which are dictated by their enemies and the Empire is losing control of their outlying provinces one by one. What is left of their government is a mess of corruption political infighting and assassinations. What faction within the Empire is capable of rebuilding armies sufficient to push back the Aldmeri while under their watchful eye? They cannot even protect their own emperor.Keep in mind that the specific destruction of mankind is not the end goal of the Dominion. Rather to unmake creation they need only controldestroy the remaining Towers of the World. Rejection of the Talos mythos is also a core necessity of the Aldmeri plan to unmake creation as the addition of Talos to the mythic reinforces the wheel of convention. Thus by supporting the Stormcloaks and ending the civil war as quickly as possible several important actions are takenA The Aldmeri lose control of the Tower in Skyrim Snowthroat. Note that there is speculation this Tower has already been lost leaving only Talos supporting Mundus.B Skyrims people can openly worship Talos especially as a continued act of defiance against the Aldmeri who attempted to stop them. C The Aldmeri can no longer operate openly in Skyrim and thus their intelligence gathering is reduced.D Skyrim with a Dragonborn was the seed for the Empires original rise to strength and the founding of the third era.Point D above is especially poignant in the Elder Scrolls universe as the process of mantling is the method by which Tiber Septim ascended to godhood as Talos in the first place.In regards to your second point the sad fact is that Skyrim is already in open civil war so the bad old days are already returned. Not to mention that challenge by combat is still largely considered an honorable tradition. If anything it paves the possibility for an early exit of Ulfric which would be especially fortuitous were the Dragonborn to be interested in the job.'},\n",

I dont think that i can put myself through that ordeal again. I dont think its justified to have a child knowing it could be a girlampknowing the consequences.So...please please please change my view!',\n",
       "  'counters': 'First of all if you had a second child with galactosemia he or she almost certainly wouldnt have the same neardeath experience and resulting developmental delays as your first child because you would know not to give breast milk or lactosecontaining formula before the results of the test came back. To the best of my knowledge galactose does not cross the placenta.Secondly I think the most wise thing to do would be to have you and your wife sit down with a professional genetic counselor before getting pregnant again. If you are both comfortable with the idea of abortion you might be able to do some testing of the fetus early in the pregnancy to determine whether it is homozygous for the GALT mutation. Odds are it wont be but if it is you could just terminate and try again.Another thing to consider is that it might be lonely for the child you already have to grow up as the sick kid. It can be really psychologically traumatizing to always be that kid whos different. So even if you had a second kid with galactosemia it might be a positive thing for the two of them to have one another. They can watch out for each other come up with recipes together and really get each other in a way that not many other people could. It could be a positive thing for your family.Also... its funny that you seem to think the worst consequence of this disease on a girl would be ovarian damage that might preclude her from having biological children yet thats what you would be forcing on your wife. At least if you had a daughter with galactosemia you could give her the heads up from childhood that carrying her own children would never be in the cards for her. She would be able to make life choices using that knowledge. Your wife on the other hand has been dreaming of having multiple babies her entire life. If someone told me that I couldnt have more than one baby I would be crushed especially if the first child was ill or a specialneeds child.TLDR I think that you guys can absolutely give pregnancy another shot if its still something your wife wants but meeting with a genetic counselor before trying is crucial.'},\n",

       "  'counters': 'Hey there! Like your son I have Galactosemia and have done quite a bit of research on the subject as a result. I think you shouldnt let the disorder which only has a chance of appearing in a second child anyway hold you back from having the family size you want. Theres only a . chance of having an affected female child and given the rate of POI you only have a or smaller chance of having a girl with reproductive issues. Thats only twice the likelihood that you would have a daughter who randomly has endometriosis or PCOS other reproductive disorders that arent at all related to galactosemia both have a likelihood of meaning that the likelihood of you having a female affected by one of those disorders is . If reproductive issues are your concern shouldnt no one have kids given that the likelihood of their child having problems is so close to the likelihood of yours having POI? Even then POI doesnt always cause infertility it can also cause subfertility reduced egg production and menstruation but still there. I am female and although I have an irregular cycle I do ovulate and could have children one day. My lowered estrogen levels are treated with birth control pills. If theres a problem getting pregnant naturally IVF could help me conceive. I wouldnt let the possibility of what could happen hold you back from having the family you and your SO want. In terms of diet I do just fine. Sure I cant have some foods but I still enjoy a varied and healthy diet. Theres constantly new food products being made without lactose and galactose. Soy rice and almond milk taste awesome and are now available in every grocery store. Theres now ice cream and other dairy products being made from these milk substitutes. I can still eat grains meat fruit and vegetables. Ive honestly not felt disadvantaged at all. In fact Id argue that Im actually healthier than most people because my diet doesnt include convenience food sweets and excessive amounts of processed food. Also the special diet shouldnt be as much of a problem if your second child is affected again this isnt as likely as the converse because your family already has to make the alterations for your son. Nowadays Galactosemia is becoming more and more manageable and by the time your kids has reached adulthood this will be even more true. In addition knowing the risks for your second child will prevent another fiasco like when your son was born. In conclusion my quality of life as a galactosemic adult isnt awful by any stretch of the word and this disorder is certainly not something to stop having children over. Of course its your family so ultimately its your choice but IMO the risks arent enough to validate a major change to the family plan you and your SO wanted.'},\n",

There is a reason why these alleles stick around in the human population they can give your children super immunity to killer diseases but they have a price.I dont want to suggest youd benefit from the gamblers fallacy and dietary restrictions arent a sure cure but there was a recent IAMA from a yearold person born with phenylketonuria autosomal recessive with a dietary treatmentwho talked about their condition. The odds are theyre going to live a normal life as long as they watch their menu.Genetic disorders arent the worst thing that can happen to a person even normal babies can die of something else. My own parents took a risk to do something that had a big risk and a big payoff but I dont resent them.

Well maybe just on reddit. But often I feel it would be helpful to have a clear and reliable definition of what counts as art so the discussion could move forward. This also addresses a common opinion that boils down to I dont like it therefore it is not art. Anyway heres my definition of art Any form of communication with at least one layer of abstraction. edit removed word attemptedHere is why I think this works. Its mediumagnostic so it can apply equally well to any type of art including spoken word performance sculpture whatever. Its nonnormative meaning we dont have to consider whether the artist did a good job or had any particular purpose. It boils down to Was there communication? even unintentional? And Was the communication abstracted in some way? By this I mean the full content isnt just explicitly stated. Examples of what is not art A stop sign is not art. Its communication you stop here but the message is not really abstracted. A random splotch of oil on the ground that looks really awesome is not art because it wasnt produced by a person to communicate anything. Jackson Pollocks work is art because there is communication about his thoughts feelings and art itself in there although it is heavily abstracted. Difficultiesobjections Indeed for example stylization of text could be considered abstracted communication. I think this is OK. Design can be considered a type of art. Yes I guess it does. BONUS ROUND My definition of Good Art which I realize is too subjective to debate meaningfully but Im throwing it in here anyway Good art helps ones fellow humans understand better. Here understand means understanding themselves others the world around them life culture etc. It is orthogonal here to the idea of knowledge in the sense of information that hasnt been emotionally integrated into ones worldview or mindset. I like this definition because it encompasses just about all art thats considered great while allowing us to reject art thats superficially wellexecuted or conceptually interesting but ultimately worthless to the human experience. For example Star Wars fan art is usually not good art. Imitative contemporary abstract nonsense is often not good art. But maybe Jeff Koons can be considered good art again? In this light Duchamps Fountain and Malevichs black squares can be more important to me anyway than ... say... Monet. Interesting!Okay thats it! What do you think is there a more useful definition of art we can use? How about good art?',\n",
       "  'counters': 'Theres a host of issues with Any form of communication with at least one layer of abstraction and Im sure youve already realized a couple but hopefully I can propose an alternative.But to begin with generally speaking a good definition of art is one that includes everything that common sense tells us is art or everything widely considered to be art is art. This is a terrible criterion for correctness but Ill get back to this in a second.There are essentially two key words in your definition communication and abstraction. Communication is problematic because theres nothing that doesnt communicate. All meaning is communication. The word communication doesnt actually exclude anything. Abstraction is also problematic. Lets take it two ways firstly abstraction meaning nonliteral which you hint at in your comments. This suffers from the same problem as communication it doesnt exclude anything. All communication is nonliteral. There is no way of communicating pure concept language is essentially metaphor. Lets consider a different meaning for abstraction abstraction as detachment. So painting something is once removed from observing the thing. This seems better but it excludes all functional art. Architecture is not detached from itself neither is industrial design. So if a good definition is one that is inclusive of all that we preemptively consider art and yours does not its not a good definition. HOWEVER there is a sound alternative to the idea of searching for a sound definition that encompasses all that is art and excludes all not art. Art is only a word. It does not need a metaphysical truth to it. The truth of the concept of art only extends so far as the word art is useful. Finding the true definition of art is fruitless because art does not exist as a perfect form but as a functional term created and used by people. So the question of What is art? doesnt actually need to be answered in a single definition. Rather art can be a network of related characteristics. So art is detached art has aesthetic qualities art is made by artists art is a historical concept art communicates content etc. can all be considered part of a definition of art and to be art something only has to meet a certain number of those criteria.As an aside on your point about good art I feel like ignoring aesthetic qualities is dangerous. By your definition art is easily replaceable by say science or philosophy or religion which are all efficient methods of reaching understanding. Additionally lots of art requires a certain level of knowledge to understand this makes it worse at being understood. Does this make the art worse?

A farmer instead has incentive to make tomatoes that last longer and can be grown year round. Making more beneficial tomatoes for society is asking farmers to sacrifice profits. The meat industry has no incentive to find more ethically reasonable systems of working. It would be a massive cut in their profits considering their current system is strictly based on efficiency and volume of product. Batteries that never die? Tires that never lose tread? Whats the incentive? If you didnt have to buy new batteries you would only spend your money one time. The cut in profits would be massive. Newspapers news stations and other media outlets answer to someone at the top of their financial food chain. Those people more often than not care about the bottom line. How many papers are we selling? how many viewers are we getting? This directly interferes with the quality of the journalism being presented by these outlets. The medical industry has a tragic lack of incentive to be as efficient as possible for the reasons already outlined above. But this issue cuts us down to even much more trivial issues When someone makes a movie based on a comic book or other intellectual property... they had the idea to do so due to the massive popularity of the source material. However... all of the movies we get inspired by this source material is reinvented and redesigned... this is to make them as middle of the road as possible so that grandma your little sister your parents and you can all potentially go see the movie. They want that bottom line the most sales. This is the primary motivation to the metaphorical raping of s and s nostalgic culture IE transformers gi joe etc. ... they see something that could get a lot of people to go to the movie theater... wipe their ass with it and move on. It doesnt matter if they do justice to the source material.. .they just need those ticket sales. The music industry has no incentive to promote quality music. Nickleback and Soulja Boi are a dime a dozen... there is a billion of them in every city. Radiohead and MF Doom are uncommon artistic talents... Artists have demands they want their work to be seen a certain way. They are difficult to work with because they dont care how much money you make by representing them their art comes first. If you can find any rapper or townyrock band promote the crap out of them and oversaturate the masses to a premeditated formula of music you cut out your necessity to rely on artists for their art. This is all in the name of your bottom line becoming fatter. The examples I could outline are almost inexhaustible.

       "  'counters': 'Error assumption of benefit. You assume that a good tasting nutritional tomato is what is of most social value. Tomatoes that last longer can reach more people poison them less and make more efficient use of food rather than throw out a larger percentage. Having them grown year round means there are tomatoes available year round. Even if some reduced nutrition it is better nutrition than not eating them at all because they arent available. Mass production of tomatoes likewise cuts costs and makes tomatoes more affordable so that the poor can eat them and improve nutrition and everybody else can afford to eat more of them.The rest of your points have similar problems so Ill refrain from addressing them one by one. It appears to me that youve just never thought through the tradeoffs and net social value. You see the item itself in a bubble and dont consider its cost its value access to it or the industry on the whole.One variation that I will address is the ethically reasonable meat production comment. Yes you are correct that flat out profit aims for pure efficiency and may lead to unethical behaviour. However that is not a problem with profit motivation or capitalism in general it is a problem with the costs and benefits tied to the activity. The solution tends to take the form of either collective regulation via our collective government or otherwise tying costs to the problems themselves known as externalities in economics. For example carbon tax adds the cost of cleaning the environment to each transaction that generates the carbon that results in the need to clean it up.Based on your title too you imply that there are other systems that would do better to help things reach full potential. To be clear the trend towards maximizing efficiency in lieu of other things is an inherent mathematical property. Natural selection works on it even. Issues like the Prisoners Dilemma and Tragedy of the Commons are not products of a given economic system but are fundamental properties of systems with social transactions between multiple stakeholders. It matters not what economic system you use they will always exist.For example imagine a system that encourages you to spend all day making one really good tomato as tasty and nutritious as you can imagine. OK so how do you survive? You could eat it and start another one the next day but would that great tomato be enough to feed you? Who provides your home? Your clothes? Etc.Maybe somebody will pay you a lot of money for that great tomato. OK but what can you buy with that money? You cant just barely buy one good tomato with it. Youll have to buy cheap food with it including cheap tomatoes but where do they come from? Ultimately you have to think in terms of units of standard of living. These are the things you as an individual actually need or want to have in your life. You need food clothes housing water sewage electricity transportation social interaction entertainment hygiene and so forth. Call the bare minimum for survival a single unit of living standard. You can even include quality as in a good tomato is more valuable in living standard units than poor quality.Ultimately how many units of living standards can you generate per hour of labour of your time? This is the very basis of society and civilization. I havent described any system here only the basic thing that matters how much do you have to work to survive or how much above mere survival can you reach with your given amount of time and energy.The more living standard units you can personally produce per unit of your time generally the better you can live. I dont mean you personally or that your goal should be to maximize it and live a life of luxury. Maybe thats your goal. What I mean is that a society that has the capability to maximize the number of living standard units per unit time or labour will generally have people in it who are thriving better than people in a society that is worse at it.Of course the division of those units of living standards must make it back to the people doing the labour so distribution matters. A slavery society can still produce a high average but most going to a few people and the rest just surviving. Hence the arguments about income distribution particularly as a function of the value of input from the people within the society. But those are distribution discussions not evaluations of the efficiency mechanism.You simply cant escape that efficiency tends to make people generally better off regardless of the system or motivation.'},\n",

I dont want to see Jewish people killed off but I think they come from a disgusting tradition that shouldnt be receiving international support. If Im wrong in this please help me see that I honestly cant right now and as much as I believe everything Ive described below I cant help but feel like an awful person for writing off the value of an entire culture. Id appreciate any constructive feedback. Thank you.The Jewish history is a history of genocide... perpetrated by the Jewish people upon their smaller and weaker neighborsand occasionally by virtue of exceptional military leadership against larger and conventionally stronger neighbors. This goes back to ancient times but is clearly true in the present day Israelis are gathering in public places by the hundreds if not thousands dancing and singing things like There are no children left in Gaza Oleh!The Palestinians are the modernday descendants of the Philistines. The Israelis are simply perpetuating an agenda of ethnic cleansing that is thousands of years old. This is how the Israelis act displaying overwhelming support suggestions place public support for the ground campaign in Gaza as high as since when does of any public support anything its government does? for genocidal endeavors.This lasts until they come up against somebody too strong for them to defeat alone at which point its poor Israelis and persecuted Jews. World War II? The Holocaust was horrible. Id agree. Thank God well never forget all the Gypsies the homosexuals the mentally disabled and other groups that the Nazis persecuted. Yknow how they made the homosexuals wear pink triangles so theyd stand out from their neighbors and could be singled out for relocation and persecution?Wait you didnt know that? Well theres no surprise. God forbid that the Holocaust be about anyone else but the Jewish people. I dont know how the history books read in other countries in America nobody mentions anyone but the Jews. There are no photographs of anyone else being persecuted. Pink triangles pinned to homosexuals? Shit even a college education over here isnt guaranteed to go into that but I knew what a Star of David was when I was four years old and why it is so awful that Hitler did what he did to those poor Jewish people and it is awful beyond awful dont get me wrong. What about Jewish rituals?Kosher food is considered pure. Yknow why? Its because the animals are killed by being first immobilized then having their necks cut approximately halfway through with a slow sawing motion. The animal is left to bleed out in pain as Jewish tradition holds that the slow bleeding out and suffering of the animal renders the meat somehow pure. Literally the suffering adds flavor and probably another thing that was necessary thousands of years ago for health reasons that is no longer necessary but is one of those mindless traditions that is indulged in for the sake of being timehonored in the case of Jewish tradition however this seems to pass from quaint to sickeningly horrifying without much exception. Jewish culture is stuck in the mindset of a world that is thousands of years gone when it was literally kill or be killed for every little tribe on the planet and a few hundred people dead could mean the end of your ethnic group. The Jews lost in WWII and are currently a stronger force than they have ever before been in human history within living memory of the Holocaust... but they dont seem to have gotten that message. Small wonder perhaps given that theyre likely fairly indignant at how the lesser races of treated them.Jews all but invented the concept of the master race. They have a word for people who arent Jewishgentile. Now this isnt so distinct from other religious groups in some fashion southern Baptists routinely refer to other people as nonbelievers and Muslims have the famous infidel but terms like these tend to have something in common they denote other people as being ideologically wrong in the viewpoint of the individuals using said terminology. This is not the case with gentile the Jews dont want to convert you. You arent pure. Gentile denotes people who are in Jewish tradition physically inferioras is also evidenced by their use of Jewish to describe themselves as a religious faith as a political state and as an ethnicity. Even the most hardcore Christians dont identify themselves as being ethnically Christian in fact theyd vehemently deny it stating that a person must be individually saved to be Christian. Not so the Jews. Theyre superior everybody else is inferior and they dont even particularly like it when someone wants to convert. And if nobodys actually giving them a hard time? Theyll make it up ample evidence suggests that the Jews were never enslaved by the Egyptians its generally accepted that the Bible story of the enslavement is a complete fabrication. The Pyramids were built by Egyptian farmers and craftspeople who were paid for their labors and well taken care of and there is no sign of the economic collapse that would have occurred had a million slaves walked out of Egypt overnight.It is possible to honor your ancestors and revere those who fell in times of horrifying carnage and catastrophe without using it to justify an ongoing tradition of genocide barbarism and delusions of physiological superiority. Yet not only are the Israelis not doing this but we America are aiding and abetting them in their ongoing vileness. These people are targeting individual wheelchairbound people with helicopter rockets and beaches of small children with warships and were paying to refill their ammunition stockpiles. It leaves me feeling positively sick.They are literally one moral step away from walking into peoples living rooms and skinning their children alive or from sacrificing people to God but you cant say anything bad about the Jews.

For one we know there were SemiticAsiatic slaves. Two the idea of a transition from a Hyksos SemiticAsiatic possibly even largely from Canaan dynasty to a non Hyksos dynasty might be similar to the transition from the pharaoh who knew Joseph to those who didnt as mentioned at the beginning of Exodus. But three and I find this most convincing people dont make up that they were slaves. If you look through myths of ethnogensis you very rarely see our lives were made difficult under the heavy yoke of slavery. Youre more likely to were we were kings no wait gods we were godkings or we sprung up from those hills right over there and have always lived here. Judaism holds that you dont actually have to be Jewish to be in right relationship with God. NonJews who follow the seven laws of Noach even merit a place in the worldtocome Jews have a different covenant with God than other peoples but different is not necessarily superior. I mean we think highly of it for us but it is not required for anybody else. Because of our acceptance of Torah Jews have a special status in the eyes of God but we lose that special status when we abandon Torah. Furthermore the blessings that we received from God by accepting the Torah come with a high price Jews have a greater responsibility than nonJews. While nonJews are only obligated to obey the seven commandments given to Noah Jews are responsible for fulfilling the mitzvot in the Torah thus God will punish Jews for doing many things that would not be a sin for nonJews. That said a gentile who wants to join the Jewish people which is not necessary but which some feel called to do is allowed to convert. The process is long and requires a lot of study because it is not a decision to be made lightly NOT BECAUSE OF PURITY. Jews are an indigenous population in Israel not foreign colonialists not that youll ever get much of the proPalestinian camp to agreeunderstand. Besides their continuous presence in the land there is extensive archeological evidence of their historical connection going back much further than just the nd century BCE i.e. not just the Bible. This doesnt negate Palestinian claims of longstanding though it does predate them. Your understanding of the history of the creation of Israel seems pretty minimal not because you think it was immoral which is an opinion held even by some very knowledgeable people but rather because of your mistaken and insanely oversimplified version of it. I recommend doing some more reading. Be sure to read accounts that challenge your preconceptions too. Intellectual honesty is the best! From askhistorians You need to see here for an explication for how the state of Israel was created and understand better this false tradition of genocide And for the ongoing tradition of genocide barbarism War is ugly and is known to cause civilians to die thats why the ICRC has a page dedicated to proportionality in attack. AndIn the immediate neighbourhood of the operations of land forces the bombardment of cities towns villages dwellings or buildings is legitimate provided that there exists a reasonable presumption that the military concentration is sufficiently important to justify such bombardment having regard to the danger thus caused to the civilian population.Israel in destroying rocket launcher who are in civilian area because HAMAS PUT THEM HERE shows he has regard of his own population and he is not at fault in doing so even in killing at the same time civilians. Israel tries to reduce the dead civilians in gaza even if its extremely difficult in populated area. civilians dead in gaza is not a small number but it would have be far greater if Israel didnt try to reduce casualities. Let cite President Obama for justifying drone strikes Every single justification Obama gives for killing civilians applies to Israel. With one major difference he is killing people a half a world away.Israelis all live at the front under direct immediate threat less than two minutes away from possibly being killed day in and day out. Nothing theoretical or indirect about it. Israelis would gladly trade places with Americans to have enemies thousands of miles away.But Hamas using human shield shows they have little to no regard for the lives of Palestinians. Under the Statute of the International Criminal Court utilizing the presence of a civilian or other protected person to render certain points areas or military forces immune from military operations constitutes a war crime in international armed conflicts.'},\n",

So we deem it absolutely necessary to at least attempt refining ones ability to communicate through the education system as a vehicle. Philosophy is parallel to this. Everyone uses philosophy adopts philosophies spouts philosophies.... but the average person does it quite poorly. Abstract thought being able handle big questions... these are skills we should be beginning to equip people with at an early age. Philosophy has a bad wrap because in a productionconsumption society it has no tangible value but the value of philosophy as a discipline is intrinsic and can effect everything we do. Just a few obvious applications and benefits to adopting critical thinking philosophy as a core discipline are Child Rearing You bring a person into the world and are tasked with guiding them the best you can through the infinite chaos of life. What is the best way to do this? How much should you intervene? Understanding your actions have tremendous influence on their developing minds.... how should you try to act and communicate? These questions and many more are abstract in nature and could be argued to be essential for any prospective parent but so many of us are not equipped to tackle such large issues. We commonly say things like I dont even want to go there... or thats too deep for me... when touching upon huge philosophical quandaries. A society which encourages critical thought and teaches us how to approach abstract questions from an early age will eventually birth a a generation of by average more prepared parents. The effects of this could be immense. Bullying A child is caught bullying another child.... the bully is called into the guidance counselors office and is asked Why did you make fun of Johnny? The bullying child will likely be rolling his eyes and saying whatever it takes to get out of the guidance counselors office at this point... and the bullying behavior will likely continue. In a society where critical thinking skills are taught from an early age the child will be used to answering why questions and thinking inward. In more circumstances by average than would likely happen now the bullying child may actually benefit from the counseling. Conformity Organized religion media peers etc. all have tremendous toxic weight on society. Freeing slaves allowing women to vote allowing homosexuals to marry allowing people to smoke weed..... these topics take far to long to filter through tradition. Critical thinking skills arm the populace with the notion of asking why and not accepting things at face value. Systems of control would have a much more difficult time normalizing the opinions of the masses. Of course the volume of examples could be vast but I assume if you are still with me you get the gist of what I am suggesting. Over the course of time a society that values critical thinking and philosophical thought as much as quantitative and linear thought would be a society that would evolve quicker and more efficiently with considerably less conflict and arbitrary systems of control.',\n",
       "  'counters': 'There are massive differences between teaching philosophy and teaching critical thinking. All the benefits you discuss stem from critical thinking.It is easy to imagine a Philosophy class that doesnt help students improve their critical thinking skills. Most class discussions Ive ever seen involve perhaps serious participants in a class of people with the majority listening but not contributing. When an essay is written later on the topic those people will primarily write rehashed versions of what was discussed in the debate but they are primarily remembering rewording and reviewing what was discussed without necessarily critically examining it and independently coming up with new insights.There has been substantial amounts of research over the last years on improving critical thinking and most of the methods that have been tried have been surprisingly ineffective. The most promising method Ive seen is the one adopted in a st year critical thinking course at the university of Melbourne known as LAMP Lots of Argument Mapping. This paper analyzed the effectiveness of philosophy courses on teaching critical thinking and came to the conclusion The metaanalysis results indicate that students do improve while studying philosophy and apparently more so than general university students though we cannot be very confidant that this difference is not just the result of random variation. More importantly studying philosophy is less effective than studying critical thinking regardless of whether one is being taught in a philosophy department or some other department. finally studying philosophy is much less effective than studying critical thinking using techniques known to be particularly effective such as LAMP.If you skip forward to page of that study theres a chart showing the effect sizes of various critical thinking interventions. Notable is that the LAMP method focused purely on critical thinking skills and almost completely devoid of anything resembling traditional philosophy is twice as effective as the nonargument mapping philosophy courses and more effective then the argument mapping philosophy courses.If you want to teach critical thinking as a core subject then ditch philosophy and instead integrate argument mapping into regular subjects.'},\n",

If a kids not doing these things then sure speak up. But its not our place to do so in the case of deodorant. So if that issue is resolved and telling a student that heshe needs to wear deodorant because of hygienic reasons isnt something that happens I still dont believe it is the teachers place to say anything to the student. The only remaining reason I see the student needs to wear deodorant is for the comfort of others. I feel its best to tell the student. I want himher to be as socially successful as possible... But its not like the kid wont make friends if heshe doesnt wear deodorant. He or she will just make a different kind of friends.

       "  'arguments': 'Let me preface this by saying Im an atheist and dont believe in any of this however if I did believe the Christian narrative was true I would probably worship Lucifer.The basis of this argument is in the fact that using deductive reasoning Yahweh is a manipulative liar.I should also add that Ill be using Lucifer and Satan synonymously if anyone wants to argue this Ill do it in the comments.Lets begin with Peter Ignoring for a moment the fact that this seems a questionable action of a good god the fact that there still exists a Lucifer who is seemingly not bound in chains of gloomy darkness but rather ruler of the underworld clearly indicative in some measure of tremendous power also calls into question Gods socalled omnipotence.Also although there is very little information about Lucifers fall from heaven in the bible how very convenient God it seems very irrational that somebody would try to challenge God in heaven given that heaven is supposed to be a utopia and why would somebody rebel in utopia? God is supposed to be allpowerful meaning that rebellion is futile.So were left with only two possible explanations. Either heaven is not a utopia and some people find Gods unchallenged authoritarian tyranny a questionable system of governance. God is not omnipotent or at the very least Lucifer is also phenomenally powerful.We can extrapolate from the incongruities in the logic of the information weve been given that God is clearly lying to us and either inflating the desirability of heaven or the measures of his own power or both. Why would somebody do this? It sounds like an elaborate propaganda campaign to win over the souls of humans at the behest of a corrupt tyrant. Plus if we conclude that God is a liar then nothing in the Bible can be taken for granted any more.But then why worship Lucifer? Well although theres very little information to go on in the Bible bad things are constantly blamed on the devil and since weve established God is a filthy propagandist this smells like an elaborate smear campaign and frankly some of it is a little fanciful.If we approach the Bible with the conclusion that God is trying to manipulate us many items that we would ordinarily take at face value become startling condemnatory evidence of a manipulative otherworldly dictator. For example Corinthians This is exactly the kind of thing I would tell people if I was a megalomaniacal tyrant and wanted to use propaganda to get people to disregard my adversary.All hail Lucifer!

       "  'counters': 'In Rabbinical Hassidic and reformed Kaballahbased Hassidic Judaism Satan is personified as a threepart angel The Adversary the Seducer and the Accuser. He is identified with the concept of Yetzer Hara or evilcorrupting influence... However in all of the angels forms he is seen as not only a devoted angel under God but also as an essential part of Yahwehs plan for all things. Its job is to serve literally as a devils advocate to god and his children. It literally exists to make arguments for evil or to try and point out flaws in Gods plan as a way of testing the Divine Creator and all his creations. The story of Job seems odd if you consider Satan and God talking casually about the nature of a mans faith but in the Jewish perspective Satan is simply doing his job and questioning all things to prove their worth.Most modern practicing Jews modern meaning from Late Antiquity onwards though some tribes have held this view for far longer reject the concept of fallen angels or a real Hell and instead highlight the idea that Evil is an abstract concept that can be attached to certain actions. Satan tempts all men with acts that are evil and then accuses and judges us before Yahweh if we fail to make the logical choice towards Godliness.Worshipping Satan for those who believe in the Jewish religion would be like valuing a hammer more than a carpenter.As for Christianity I would look at views of each individual sect of Christianity or at least the views of many popular ones... Remember that before the codification of the holy books of the Christian people by Constantine many Christians rejected the concept of personified angels and demons instead taking the same view that many early forms of Eastern Orthodoxy still follow. Angels are seen as things that cannot fall because they are not close to humans in thought or purpose. They are viewed as literal aspects of God himself serving only as extensions of His will. Many aspects of what people consider the largest parts of Christianity were adopted only during the long incubating period that took place from the fall of Revenna rise of the postJustinian ByzantineRoman empire and the sequestering of theological thought in various monasteries from Ireland to Russia. The idea of a fallen angel is very much an adopted idea for Christianity in many parts of Christendom.In fact even Ethiopianstyle Christianity one of the oldest direct sects surviving today still upholds holy parables and stories talking about events such as Jesus the child commanding Satan to leave him as he was God himself and therefore only able to be judged by the quality of his works not by the fabric of his character. In many of these sects they traditionally question even the power of Jesus and his angels instead seeing God as an alien force and all religious stories from the bible and beyond as parables and moral allegories rather than an accurate account of the World.In this notunpopular Christian viewpoint Satan is either once more a direct pawn of God that serves his purpose endlessly or nonexistent as an independent entity often nothing more than an allegory for the evil that pervades a freewilled Mankind. For these people both the Jewish argument and the argument that Satan does not exist as the king of demons both apply.While Satan might exist as a being of great power for many mainstream Christian groups for plenty of people the entire argument that Satan could deserve to be worshipped is irrelevant.I apologize for poor flow or or spelling errors but I am on Mobile with poor signal.For those in one of the highly westernized version of either religion the argument against Satan is much simpler... God is the creator of all things and is explicitly described as not only omnipotent and omniscient but in many cases omnipresent. Panthiesm and Panenthiesm catholic trinity worldview or the monomyth view in all of them God is the end all and be all of all things. If Lucifer sways many people to his side it is only because God allowed it. If god decides to murder said people with a sudden hail of razorblades and God declares this a good or moral action...? It is a moral action. You disagree because he allows you. In worshipping Satan you may as well be worshipping god even if you piss him off in doing so because he controls all things and even Satan is just a computer program to him. Maybe Satan is one he made to rebel or spread freethought and sin against him but it is still HIS Satan. In the mainstream Judeochristian system of beliefs there is no such thing as Lucifer deserving of worship more than god because God holds dominion over your soul in heaven or hell because god in all Western holy texts is all things. You are only allowed to question him because he either has some freaky plan involving free will or he allows you to.'},\n",

       "  'arguments': 'I dont believe women want sex nearly as much as men do.This is a generalization of course. There are a great many women with high sex drives of course. But in general I believe that men at large are more desiring of sex. One reason I believe this is that men patronize prostitutes in significant numbers and men are willing to trade things of real value like money in order to get sex. I cant think of any scenario in which women are willing to give up something of significant value in order to get sex. I also believe this is true because testosterone is largely responsible for the human sex drive. The more testosterone you produce the more libidinous you are. Men who have lower testosterone have less of a sex drive. These men seek out testosterone treatment and notice a dramatic increase in sex drive once the treatment becomes effective. Women produce significantly less testosterone than men consequently their sex drives are typically lower. Women are less proactive when it comes to seeking out sex partners. I dont have support for this one but in my experience men are the ones who are proactive about directly asking women out or making direct romantic gestures. Its usually incumbent upon men to do the asking to make the first move. Men are compelled to play by these rules because women are the ones who have the thing that men desire and men are the ones who are forced to act because of the desire. Also men are much more likely to say yes to a request for an immediate sexual encounter than women are. According to this study women were much much less likely to say yes to a proposal for immediate sex whereas men were much much more likely to say yes. Watch this video. Many of the men features men leap at the change to have sex with the girl despite the fact that she could be leading them into some kind of trap or that she could have an STD of some kind. There are only a few examples I know there is another video in which is about as well but the average of men that say yes it much higher than the average in the gender opposite video. The ones who dont leap to sleep with her at least seriously consider doing it this is because they want very badly to have sex with a beautiful girl. The women in this video dont react nearly as positively. None of them leap at the chance. They arent instantly aroused the way the men are by even the proposal. I think its reasonable to conclude that the desire just isnt as intense. You might argue that the desire becomes as intense when the desire is provoked and that this situation does not provoke the desire but if its so difficult to provoke the same amount of desire doesnt that mean that there is less desire in general? please!',\n",

This doesnt negate Palestinian claims of longstanding though it does predate them. Your understanding of the history of the creation of Israel seems pretty minimal not because you think it was immoral which is an opinion held even by some very knowledgeable people but rather because of your mistaken and insanely oversimplified version of it. I recommend doing some more reading. Be sure to read accounts that challenge your preconceptions too. Intellectual honesty is the best!What sort of moral process are you looking for when the modern world recognizes a new state? A UN sponsored plan to fairly partition disputed territory into states? Wait thats exactly what happened see the Partition Plan! But one side the Arabs rejected that plan and almost immediately after the plan passed in the UN a civil war broke out between the two sides with the British just sort of putzing around in the middle. After the British left and the Mandate ended Israel declared its independence. All the neighbors realizing that there was booty to be had and recognizing that the locals werent getting the job done decided that they would invade too. In the end Israel was still there. Only it had got rid of the ridiculously untenable from a militarydefense standpoint shape of the partitioned state. The armistice lines werent great but were better than the kissing corners. i.e. they were still almost undefendable from the West Bank. In the process lots of Palestinians were either forced to flee the fighting were evacuated were expelled were killed or moved out of Jewish controlled areas. At this point your recommendation was what? For Israel to say Well your community has just tried to kill ours and you still dont recognize our right to our own land and youre still dedicated to ending our new state and generally refuse to live under Jewish government even in areas where Jews are the majority. But come back and well just forget that all happened and be friends.? We think we should have this land is maybe the most important guiding principle in the history of geopolitics. In answer to your question I would just ask how is Israel different from pretty much every single other country in the world? The only differences I see are how long ago the conflicts were fought and that mainly the old ones were settled by one side completely annihilatingsubsuming the other or exiling them e.g. see how the Jews were forced out of Israel originally.'},\n",

And its not something we expect religious people to understand. Quite the contrary we often vent about how ignorant religious people are to the perspectives of others.Figure . This is one of my favorite political cartoons because of how well it summarizes the interplay between theists and atheists. We are constantly disrespected for our lack of belief and no one but us gets offended by it.Heres an example my friends and I had a cookout Saturday. Were sitting around on the deck getting ready to jump in the pool and the topic of whats appropriate to post on facebook comes up. One friend comments that I can be kinda mean on facebook and I say well only about religion but you know how I am. I dont post antireligious things I just respond to religious antihuman posts with vehemence. My friends wife decides to pipe up oh are you an atheist? Ill miss you. and I just raise an eye at her. She continues but why do you want to go to hell so bad? I bit my tongue because shes my friends wife and I wanted to just chill and enjoy the day. I just say its unfortunate to you that your delusion doesnt apply to me. And of course this makes ME the asshole. Why? She can sit there and tell me she wants me to suffer endless torment simply because I dont believe in her diety but its not ok for me to tell her shes mistaken? How is the latter even nearly as offensive as the former?But religious people dont see this. To them that was perfectly acceptable. Some think that it wasnt just acceptable its what she was supposed to do as a good Christian.Its absolutely maddening.Figure . Blasphemy Laws. This is something that comes up again and again and has been pushed both globally and within the United States. This fits with figure wherein were supposed to respect now under pain of death the religious right to attack us. iirc the UN changed their stance in to reflect protecting religious believers rather than religious beliefs which is a step in the right direction but still damnable. Why dont the nonreligious deserve to be protected? I dont believe the Christians of the world are any less bloodthirsty than the Muslims. While the common response Christians counter such laws with is that Islamic Nations would be free to attack and persecute people on religious grounds they would do it too. I read far more often about Christianityfueled violence than Islamic. Its just socially acceptable for Christians to be violent. Hell they think its commendable. Blow up a Planned Parenthood kill a faggot murder and injure over children at summer camp torch a mosque all in the name of their god. The mass murderer Breivik has a cult of devout followers who think hes the bees knees because he struck a blow against Islam in the name of his god. Yet we atheists are the disgusting abhorrent immoral ones.Im not antitheist. Im happy to let people persist in whatever delusions they please. Im not their psychologist I dont care about other peoples mental wellbeing enough to feel that they should be freed. I only get involved when they attempt to restrict my own freedom for delusional reasons. Birth control is bad? Give me a single argument against birth control that doesnt involve religion or religious assumptions. Homosexuality is bad? Give me a single argument against homosexuality that doesnt hinge on religion or religious assumptions. These injustices I fight against and name myself atheist in defense of. I stand beside my gay brothers not as a gay man but as an atheist who believes that religion should not be any reason to persecute someone in either direction. I am a feminist despite having a penis because I believe all humans are equal rather than subscribing to the religious notion that women are designed to be subservient to men. I am an atheist because women deserve freedom and gay people should be free to love who they please.I dont often post to ratheism because the majority of posts are just people bitching. However Ive never once thought their complaints were trivial or unjustified. More importantly Ive never felt that they were unatheist for being outraged by theism.The venom towards religion thats seen in atheist communities such as ratheism is not unwarranted nor does it even begin to measure up to the hatred we experience daily from theists. It is very much a central topic to the community and so is absolutely appropriate in such a subreddit. rantitheism should be about opposition to religion.I feel this touches on another important topic that I just want to brush over real quick. Not approving of something not liking something is not the same as disliking it or condemning it. I dont like plain hotdogs. I dislike cottage cheese. Theres a huge difference. All to often people conflate dont like and dislike. Being outraged by hatred directed towards you is not the same as being hateful.Another point is that being proud of what and who you are is not the same as hating everything thats different from it. Gay people dont celebrate gay pride because they hate straight people. Black people dont celebrate their heritage because they hate white people. While its possible that individuals here and there will do both correlation does not imply causation.I once made the mistake of leaving the God Delusion on the front seat of my car when I came back the window was busted out the book was torn up and thrown all over the cab and a cross was spray painted on the hood.

I also want this law to be repealed and for this discrimination against sexual minorities to end.However as people who follow this issue are aware the African nations that have these laws on their books have resisted calls to repeal these laws. They view calls for repeal as the West trying to impose its moral standards on Africa which has expressed its morality through the passage of these laws. I am aware of the logical inconsistency of this position i.e. that the homophobia is a result of the adoption of religion which itself is a Western import and do not want to discuss that here. What I do wonder is that the leaders of these nations have asked that they be respected as sovereign nations and for the West to respect their laws. They say that just as they do not impose their cultural norms on the West the West should not impose their cultural norms on Africa and the most common example they cite is that of polygamy. It is very common in several African nations but I was surprised to learn is actually criminalized in the US and Canada. So if the West criminalizes the African cultural practice of polygamy and is unwilling to repeal the laws that do so then surely African nations can criminalize homosexuality and the West should leave them alone.Im not sure how to mount an argument to this. The right to marry a consenting spouse is in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights so if a womanman decides to marry another manwoman with an existing spouse it should not be criminal as long as the three of them consent to it.

Rather theyre trying to force their own moral standards on homosexuality and polygamy were that to be a hot topic on African nations. Polygamy isnt a hot topic so it isnt discussed.

       "  'arguments': 'While I was still going to public school in America most of my history classes focused more on the Declaration of Independence rather than the Constitution. We focused so much on it I thought that the Declaration of Independence was the most important document America ever had. While it definitely isnt unimportant the DoI was more a list of reasons why the King of England sucked and why they wanted independence as their own nation. The Constitution however is the backbone to how America is run far more relevant to modern American life than the Declaration.Granted st and nd graders might not fully understand what the Constitution is and its easier to teach the Declaration to them but I think that th and th graders would definitely be able to understand the basics of the Constitution Bill of Rights and amendments perhaps even rd graders.The Declaration is great for when you want to teach kids about the Revolutionary War. However theres not much of a need to spend so much time on it since in my opinion its just not as relevant to American life as the Constitution. While its important its more important to teach about history that had a bigger impact on todays world. The Constitution is a prime example for American life since its still being used and referenced all the time today! When was the last time you heard of the Declaration of Independence in the mainstream news? Okay Nicholas Cage stole it in a movie once but other than that nothing much. The Constitution is constantly in the news however and in order for any of the branches of government to do anything they have to look up the Constitution to see if its okay.I think that if we teach American kids early on what the Constitution is theyre more likely to know how the law actually works how the country is run and the actual intent the Founding Fathers had for America. They might also become more interested in politics in their adult lives since they would actually know how the American government is structured. Plus with the Constitution it would also help teach students how America changed over time and what the values and standards were for American people living a hundred or two hundred years ago. It might even get them to debate amongst themselves if they agree with parts of the Constitution or not and its important for kids to learn how to properly have a debate and not just a bunch of angry arguments.Most of the kids I know can barely name any amendments except for like freedom of speech and they seem to be under the impression that freedom of speech means that you can say whatever you want and shouldnt have to have any social repercussions for it right to guns and womens suffrage. Its almost like they only take the time to learn about the Constitution when they need to win an argument. Now my generation for lack of a better word is still young and we havent really fully developed into adults yet but how can a country be functional if the people dont know how their Constitution works including the parts they dont like about it?TLDR Kids would benefit more from learning about the Constitution at an early age rather than the Declaration of Independence.',\n",

The Constitution is a legal document and if youre going to go over it in detail thats probably best done in a law class. The intricacies of this document are important for people to understand but they are pretty subtle and take a lot of explanation.

These areas would include much of the eastern and southeastern United States. This would lead to the collapse of much of civilization and untold numbers of deaths would surely follow. I admittedly dont know much about climate science and Im hoping if I did I would be able to dismiss this but from what Ive read it seems fairly solid.Even the US Navy has predicted an icefree arctic by which seems to support the idea that global warming is increasing at an exponential rate.I would really really like my view on this changed.',\n",

Even the big time warners about global warming like James Hansen acknowledge we are uncertain about how negative and positive feedback loops will interact and therefore exactly how quickly warming can be expected to occur. But not McPherson he ignores all possible negative feedback loops.And extinction? Really? No one survives for at least a little bit? Bold statement with no evidence to back it up.

There is the phrase Absolute power corrupts absolutely. A world police that has authority over the world is inherently flawed. Would the entire world democratically elect these officials? Even if we could find a way to elect them fairly with enough laws in place to ensure that they wouldnt be able to cater to some groups to ensure votes once they were in a position of power they would inevitably get corrupted in that position.

For this to work every country would have to agree to give another governing body higher authority than their own government on their territory. Well either agree or have it forced upon them which would cause its own slew of problems.

If a court of law decides that the case shouldnt go to trial why should Roger Goodell suspend him for any extended amount of time? I agree that he should face some form of discipline and two games seems a fair punishment if not excessive.

So please Reddit change my view.',\n",

It in no way says he is innocent and if anything implies he is guilty its just a way to make the situation better without putting the spouse in jail. Rice also apologized for his actions which makes it pretty clear he behaved badly in some way. So its completely false to imply the court considers him not guilty.As for the NFL they have been coming down hard on other behaviors. Ben Roethlisberger was initially suspended for games for sexual harassment that he wasnt even formally charged with Rice was not only charged but the charges were upgraded Josh Gordon for an entire season for marijuana and A.J. Jefferson was suspended for games for domestic assault. So a game suspension seems pretty weak when compared to other suspensions and when Goodell is supposed to be getting tough on outside problems then it really seems weak.Domestic assault is a problem in the NFL. You have aggressive men with huge egos and there are going to be problems. It should be important for them to take the issue seriously.

       "  'counters': 'It seems there are two basic strategies for paying off debt Elimination and Consolidation.Elimination has the following core concept You choose one loan. Pay minimums for all other loans and put as much money as you can spare towards the one you chose. There are two methods of choosing which loan to pay extra on Snowball Pay off the smallest debt first Avalanche Pay off the highest interest rate firstMathematically speaking out of the two and you agree with this in your post its obvious that the Avalanche method ends up paying the least amount of money once all debts are paid off. The argument for Snowball is that it will eliminate the number of debts the fastest.The Consolidation strategy is to get a loan from one source for an amount which lets you pay off all of your other debts. Its only worthwhile if this loan has a lower interest rate than the debts it is paying off and thus the minimum amount spent per month is less and the total amount spent overall is less. This is especially true if much of the debt is in credit cards or if there is a significant collateral for the loan such as a nd mortgage on a home.I would argue that out of these three methods the Snowball method is both the least effective and the worst option.For someone who is in debt they will have one of two mutually exclusive goals Pay off their debt as quickly as possible lose the least amount of money to interest OR Lower their monthly payment more spending money for essentialsFor either goal in most cases of highinterest debt debt consolidation is a smart move to begin with. This has no downsides monthly minimums are lower less debt is accruing fewer bills need to be paidremembered it helps the credit score and overall less money is being lost to interest. The only mistake which can be made is paying an overall higher interest rate than the preconsolidated loans. Its easy to avoid only consolidate loans which have a higher APR than the new loan.Now the decisions start to change depending on the goal. If the goal is to pay off their debt quickly then by definition they will want to spend as much money as possible each month paying down their debt. In this case the Avalanche method is clearly the superior method because they can directly and immediately lower the principal owed on their largest interest debt thus eliminating any more interest paid on that principal. Its mathematically the fastest way to eliminate the debt and thus the smartest move to make.If the goal is to lower monthly payments then clearly this person has no extra money to spend per month anyway. Thus they would go with debt consolidation with a relatively longterm loan and just pay the minimums. The total monthly payment will be much lower than if the debt remained on credit cards or shorterterm loans.Neither of these cases leave room for the Snowball method. Its fiscally irresponsible and is ineffective compared to the alternatives. What goal would a person have which the Snowball method actually achieves better than some combination of Avalanche andor consolidation? I cant think of any.'},\n",

I can buy a lego set with instructions on how to make a race car and end up with a space ship if I dont follow the instructions. Doesnt make my space ship a car though. There are cases where the human body doesnt get the right bath of hormones in the uterus when developing or the sex organs dont develop the right way or any number of things dont go according to plan and you end up with someone who is not strictly male or female. They would have physical qualities of both. Your physical sex isnt a binary option. Its a generalization. Male generally means This person has a penis and the stuff that goes along with it. Female generally means This person has a vagina and the stuff that goes along with it. But not having a penis does not imply having a vagina. One can have both or at least parts of both. A person can be genetically male but have breasts and no penis. These things happen. And even if we ignore that if we really do decide that the genes are the only determining factor and that XY is man and XX is woman then what about people who have neither of those combinations? So the situation is clearly more complex than just man or woman which is determined by genes alone. Now to address your main point. There is evidence that male and female brains develop slightly differently. What actual differences in brain function this causes isnt really that well understood but then again the brain isnt well understood in general. However among people who claim to be stuck in the wrong body we can scan their brain and see that there are abnormalities in themThis is what is meant when someone says they are stuck in a body of the wrong sex. Their brain very literally thinks its supposed to be in a body of the opposite sex. This isnt just an idea its something related to the wiring of your brain. Given that its much easier to change you body than your brain and that your brain is usually much more strongly associated with your identity many people say theyre suck in the wrong body and often do things to change it.'},\n",

PThese masses of baddies as an obstacle to be killed suck whether theyre male female human or not The Hobbit had that dreadful scene with the goblins... how many died that day? The thinking behind it is just weird to me. Granted if you had a game or film full of female human baddies and a thousand of them bit the bullet there would be something of an outcry because it would feel exceptional. But its basically the same idea as Goombahs and Creepers. I like Creepers.When you have a female character however who is part of the plot who has a name and as such is not supposed to be considered an obstacle to victory but instead an ally she really ought to have some level of agency.Both sets of objectifications are crappy to me and Ill turn off a game or film if theres too much of either.

Therefore you have to get over racism sexism homophobia etc. Therefore there is a psychological and educational component to social liberalism. People have to learn to stop seeing the world through the lens of artificial differences before you can create a truly equal society. Therefore liberals support tolerance only to the degree that tolerance serves the higher more important purpose of freeing people from social coercion. In that worldview it makes no sense to be tolerant of people whose views lead them to be highly coercive.

A quick search gives us thisWhile this is good enough I dont think its sufficient. This may be the definition of art but it is hardly the purpose. The purpose of art imo is to convey a complex idea. And that is really what comes into question when it comes to Video Games. Nobody could really contest that a game creator uses creative skill and imagination to make their product. The contention comes when you think about whether games convey an idea or are simply entertainment. In the rest of this post I will show firstly the difference between things in a medium that do and do not fulfill the purpose of art. I will then show how video games are a superior art form as opposed to moves painting and the like. Finally Ill show some examples of games that fit into the categories of art and nonart. I realize that Im dealing with a lot of abstracts here and its impossible to be truly objective but Ill do my best to represent what I mean.What does and does not fit the definition and purpose of artThe easiest medium for this would be photography. First ill show some pictures that fulfill neither the definition or purpose of art this is not art this is not art and this is not art The second category is a bit more difficult but here are some that fit the definition of art but not the purpose This fits the definition of art so does this and this They are all certainly a product of human creativity and fit the definition of art. But what complex idea do they convey do they meet the purpose of art?Finally pictures that meet both the definition and purpose of art This is one Another Id even say this tooI was planning to do music and movies as well but these media are much more difficult to breakdown and as a result it would make this about twice as long and three times as abstract.Why Video Games are a Superior Art FormThe main idea here is that video games are interactive. You directly experience the feeling or idea that is being represented in the work. This makes it a much more powerful and personal experience than watching a movie or listening to a song. I have never went to a friend and talked for minutes about how a song in which the artist was portraying their anger and talked about how angry I was. But I have had a bad game experience and went to talk to my friend for minutes about how I was mad. What im trying to say is best represented in this quote ...you dont have to empathize with a character on a screen the feeling happens directly to you. Its like taking the phrease show dont tell and moving it to the next level feel dont show. I find that games are the best art form because they fulfill the purpose of art in a way no other medium thus far can possibly hope to.Most of this power comes from good game design but this is also true of other forms of media. A badly made movie will fail to show the struggle of a fatherson dynamic as well as The Godfather.I realize that this is going to be the most controversial pert of my post so fell free to reply even if you think that video games are an art form but not the best as I claim here.What games do and do not fit the definition and purpose of artNote I am not saying that the games listed here are good or bad simple whether or not the fit the definition and purpose of art. Ill be using commonplace titles so that even people who dont play very many games will have a general idea about what game Im talking about.Games that do not fit the definition of art FIFA Farmville and Solitaire . You can see that most of these are simulations of things in real life and are not very creative mostly they fill the purpose of simple entertainment or time filling. This is not to say that simulations cannot be artful as rd World Farmer is a simulation game that fulfills the purpose of art very well.Games that fit the definition of art but not the purpose. Super Mario Bros. Its hard to think of specific examples of this but I think the one is sufficient. Its a very creative and well designed game.Nest are games that fulfill both the definition and purpose of art. In this section Ill talk for a short biit about what parts of these games make it artful. Amnesia The Dark Descent this game is fear and panic incarnate. Mark of the Ninja ever wonder what its like to be a ninja? Papers Please this game is really difficult to describe pretty much you are a worker at the boarder of an oppressive dictatorship its definitely worth a play if you are looking got something truly unique. Lastly Antichamber for if you ever want to break your brain.With games I have added a th category that comes directly due to interactivity. These ae games that can be art. I think what I mean by that will become more clear as I show some examples. Call of Duty of course you have the well known year old who slept with everyone mother but many parts of this game are powerful message about what war is like there are better representations of this but this game fits this category very well. League of Legends this game can be anything from a mindless time sink to an immersive experience where you directly experience victory defeat panic triumph fear and even the occasional sportsmanship. The Elder Scrolls V Skyrim this is truly the best representation of this category anybody who has played can tell you about the amazing landscapes I just gotta freak out for a second when I first saw the Soul Cairn my brain exploded. And the last area of the main quest just makes you feel like a badass who has crossed worlds to beat this evil its just awesome. The potential art in this game is immense from the world design even to how the character interacts allows the player to fell and be something the never could. This is what I mean by the category can be art. These games fulfill the purpose of art if the player makes it so.TLDRGames are a superior art form because they have interactivity and allow the player to directly feel the idea that is being conveyed by the creators.

First of all even as a woman I find that an extremely childish point of view. To need birth control. I would like to preface this by saying that yes I am aware of the various conditions that birth control aides and for the sake of this those are not what Im talking about here. For all nonmedical reasons no one needs birth control.I am a huge advocate for safe sex and the prevention of pregnancy and the spread of STDs through birth control and condoms. That being said I dont think sex is a basic human right. No one needs to have sex every three days or theyll face death maiming etc. Sex is pleasurable and sex is fun and sex can create life. But by no means is it a necessity in the way that many claim it is. Furthermore claiming that your healthcare should be required to cover birth control outside of health concerns because its a basic right is absolutely ridiculous.If you are not prepared to make birth control a priority by budgeting for it then you need to make the decision to either practice unprotected sex and face the consequences or abstain until you can afford to make birth control a priority. Here are some of the main reasons why I think so Birth Control doesnt have to be super expensive as low as a month. If you cant afford a month for birth control you definitely cant afford a kid and should be able to abstain until you are more financially stable. There are other nonpenetrative methods for sexual release If you cant make birth control a priority for your own personal budget then why should you expect your health care to. I know this treads very closely with past s on birth control being included in health care but in this case I think its hard to talk about one without the other. I personally think persecuting companys for refusing to provide birth control in their health care package not that the woman couldnt just buy it without insurance! is as assine as getting upset if an orthodox jewish meat company refused to purchase pork for their work cafeteria.

Thats not to say we always live by that rule of course you can point out any number of exceptions but that doesnt change the principle.You may be thinking thats not true thats not a principle we live by... but let me point out that if you agree crimes are wrong which you implicitly are saying when you say you support capital punishment then you are agreeing with the premise because crimes for which capital punishment comes into play by their nature are based on causing the suffering of others. It may not be longlasting suffering for the individual a gunshot to the head typically for example but in most cases it causes longlasting suffering to SOMEBODY be it family friends or just the innocent bystander that discovered the body thats a pretty terrifying thing I imagine!Put another way if you believe its okay to cause suffering when punishing someone for an action you deem unacceptable why is it that you deem the action unacceptable in the first place? Its just suffering in either case right? Why is one form of suffering acceptable while another is not? You can point to one and say its justified because its suffering in payment for an act that caused suffering but that makes the whole thing entirely arbitrary... some actions that cause suffering are okay while others are not... who gets to decide?One other reason Ill toss in is simply that it does no good whatsoever. We all kind of romantically think that if we punish someone in an eyeforaneye kind of way that well somehow feel better about things. However if you do just a little bit of research you quickly will reach the conclusion that to those affected by the original crime they get no real satisfaction in seeing the offender suffer. And it makes sense that it would be that way if your daughter is raped and murdered and you see the bastard that did it raped and murdered you may well feel a little twinge of happiness at first but then a you quickly remember that your daughter is STILL dead and STILL suffered the rape and b that now you actually feel a little bit disgusted with yourself because you felt joy about the suffering of someone else even someone that deserved it. MOST people arent wired that way thankfully... MOST people dont take pleasure in the suffering of others even if they intellectually think the person deserves it so theres simply no point in eyeforaneye punishment and in fact it can be very counterproductive in terms of people getting over the trauma they suffered.I dont think anything is actually gained by causing additional suffering for criminals no matter how heinous the crime. Their removal from society either through imprisonment or death so they cannot repeat their offense is all thats required. Anything more and you have to start asking if the original offense was really bad in the first place and dealing with the unintended consequence of going against the basic principle of not causing suffering and the basic wiring of the psyche of MOST people in adhering to that principle.'},\n",

But that is not what this is about I just think its important and fair to be clear where Im coming from. What this is stemming from is that I watched a documentary last night Schooled the Price of College Sports. If you want a more in depth understanding you can watch it or Ill just give the very brief summary as I understood it. One side says players should be compensated for the work they do. The other side says it is essentially extracurricular activities and they are students merely taking part in activities while at college and that paying them would ruin college sports. Now this was a pretty slanted documentary but I was still able to appreciate the perspective from both sides. On one hand the reality is that college sports players are part of a big business that makes lots of money. On the other hand school should exist for learning not creating a big profit making businesses centered around sports. My view is this The problem is not the coaches or the schools making money and not paying the students afterall they all just have a job and are trying to be paid as best that they can. Fine I have no issues with that. On the other hand those students are making a LOT of money for other people and not seeing a dime for it. What the problem really is to me is that people should stop supporting the entire system altogether. Paying or more... If you want sports entertainment you should go pay professional sports entertainment. The only reason those sports should exist within a college setting is for the players themselves something to do on the side while theyre attending school. The moment the populace starts being willing to pay them vast sums of money and pay such a mind to star college athletes they have become the problem. Leave the students alone to learn and do what they want to do on the side while theyre there. I say the fans are the only solution to the problem because both the NCAA and the Studentathletes are right in what they say. The fact is there just shouldnt be that much money being generated for college sports and the only reason there is is because fans are obsessive and willing to pay ridiculous amounts of money to them. I believe fans are wrong to do this and should stop and that if youre a fan of college sports a paying fan of college sports that you should stop contributing to a problem that can only be solved by you ceasing to provide them so much ridiculous money.',\n",

If I want to see a high level of play Im not going to see it at anything less than the college level.Maybe in an ideal world where sports are completely separated from Education but thats just not the reality. Sport scholarships are help many students afford college. Sport participation is generally considered to be good for developing students. Encouraging physical activity is also kind of a big paramount what with the growing child obesity problem the in the USA.Students at college are going to want to watch their college sports team play.Alumni of a college are going to want to watch their college sports team play.People in the city are going to want to watch their local college sports team.This is not going to change.

The more situations they face and they more they are exposed to unpredictable human drivers the better they get at predicting and reacting to them. The vehicles are consistently driven less and less by their human controllers as they learn to handle more situations. Although for example because they have only driven in certain parts of CA they dont handle roundabouts well at all.

Id like somebody to talk me through the economic reasoning for having interest before discussing the pros and cons and moral implications.The reason I believe it should be banned at the moment is because it allows money to be made simply from having wealth. It is a vehicle for the wealthy to accumulate wealth from the poor. Also there is no choice. If you want a loan or have a bank account you MUST payreceive interest. There is no way you can withdraw your consent on ideological grounds therefore we are trapped by interest. What are the results of this? It means payday loan companies like wonga can carry out statesanctioned theft of your possessions and home to cover your debts. It means that you are penalised for not being rich. To say this is allowed when really there is no way you can disagree with the system seems wrong to me.But why ban it? I admit I have only been clued into this view because usury is something that is criticised in Abrahamic religions. My view is not well informed and so I would like some people to convince me of the opposite view.. So the main benefits of interest seem to be compensating financiers for lending money allowing small businesses to have access to capital and allowing people to own items they otherwise wouldnt be able to. I am realising that economies will grind to halt if financiers cannot make money out of lending money without a viable alternative.. There does seem to be an alternative to interest in the form of Islamic Banking whereby interest is not charged. Another system has been illustrated by uProjectShamrock here Whether these are good or bad systems is still unclear to me but it illustrates alternatives are possible..

Why is it our concern? Well because S. Korea is our ally. They provide economic benefit plus theyre a strongish military presence in Asia which allows the US to station their own military presence in the area. This relationship wouldnt work out if S. Korea didnt symbolize US standards for a country. It also wouldnt work out if the US didnt state military support for S. Korea if N. Korea attacked whether invasion or nuclear attack. This should be more than enough reason as to why we help other countries but I assume youre thinking more about situations like Crimea and the Malaysian crash so Ill try to talk about that. Well technically it has none immediately. But lets consider how the Ukrainian situation could play out. Lets say Ukraine ended up handling the Crimea invasion differently and fired shots. Well now Russia feels they have precedent to invade mainland Ukraine. The Ukraine isnt in NATO so we have no legal reasons to help still. But Poland and Lithuania hold Ukraine as an ally and may defend them. This now gives Russia reason to move into these additional countries. Well these countries happen to be NATO now. As far as I know we still have no legal reason to help because theyre not the defending party. Basically the point Im getting at is when does it become our problem. The situation doesnt feel as pressing in America but when youre in Europe it feels very different. Other countries that are closer allies to us could get involved until the majority of Europe is involved. Now youve got a WWIII scenario. You might look back at WWII and think well of course we should have joined the war with the Allies and attack the Nazis but thats because youre looking back on it rather than living it. Hitler was given appeasement just as allowing Russia to have Crimea is a form of appeasement. WWI and II didnt start over nite. They started from many problems that snowballed into larger and larger ones. Now lets say America is the same geopolitical force now but place them into the s. Germany has just taken half of Poland. By your logic it wouldnt be our concern however the US could easily put a stop to it. Why not? Basically the point is political situations across the world arent standalone. They leave resentment and loss to some countries fear in others and a drive for more in others. Hell the annexation of Crimea has led to rebels whom may be rebels or may not be depending on who you trust shooting down an aircraft killing hundreds of people. This leads to the point thats far more important than any other in my opinion. We can stop people from killing more. These rebels in the Ukraine have killed hundreds of innocents now. People that werent involved. The Ukrainian government doesnt appear apt to handle the situation but the US can more than deal with it. If the US worked towards capturingkilling the rebels think of how many lives would be saved? Would they be saved American lives?

In order to beat him you have to outrun him through a maze like structure and get to the top of the structure. Doing this normally could take a little longer than a minute. Perhaps less I dont know the exact amount of time but definitely significantly more than when using the exploit. Performing the Brownie Skip the player is placed into the race runs immediately to the right outside of few and pauses the game and then ends up being able to land on top of the platform that was initially impeding their progress. If you dont know or that explanation didnt make sense here is what it looks like. In my opinion this and tactics like it dont belong in speed running. While it does make you beat the game faster youre not actually playing the game. Youre playing who knows how and when to pause the game and how to wiggle the stick the best. The idea of speed running is about being able to beat the game the fastest and bosses are an important part of the game. Actually beating the boss shows off more skill by far. !',\n",
       "  'counters': 'But the entire purpose of a speed run is to finish the game as quickly as possible not to play the game.Youre being disingenuous if you dont think that same description can be applied to every single aspect of a game. Beating bosses is simply playing who know how and when to press buttons and how to wiggle the stick the best. Just because certain mechanics werent intended by game developers doesnt make them part of the game.Thats true but youre conflating two different goals here. A speedrunners goal is to get from start to finish as quickly as possible not to the game.I actually disagree. For many exploits in many games there are two major areas of skill needed. The skill to figure it out in the first place e.g. some Super Mario World exploits require some knowledge of how the game stores memory and manipulates the gameplay. That takes more skill than figuring out how to beat a boss.. The skill to do things pixelperfect. Most bosses can be beaten fairly easily by skilled players and require nowhere near the level of perfection as many exploits.'},\n",

To me the most significant manifestation of this issue is the tremendous amount of support for legislation that would disallow anyone diagnosed with a mental illness to own a firearm. At first thought such a measure seems to make sense. Surely this legislation would make it such that dangerous mentally ill people cannot obtain firearms making the world a safer place.But consider this. A man returns from active duty and decides that he wants to purchase a pistol to protect himself. The man is experiencing PTSD symptoms but knows that if he seeks help he will be barred from purchasing a gun so what does he do? He hides the symptoms hes experiencing and he buys a gun. So then instead of having an armed mentally ill man who is seeking treatment and whose symptoms are being controlled you have an armed man who needs medication or at the very least professional help. Legislation like this deters people from seeking help for their mental illnesses and puts guns in the hands of more unstable people. To me thats why this type of legislation makes no sense.

But past that if a kid can give consent to be picked up to be punched by his friends to ride a bike to ride a car why can heshe not give consent to sex? Of course this view must hold that those even those younger than those that can speak can give consent but I wont go there in this as I will get a bunch of hate mail and witchhunts as is common in western societys irrational hatred of anyone defending the pedos. So what makes sex so taboo for children? I argue that it is subjective. You grew up seeing it as dirty so you dont want your or others children engaging in it because you see it as dirty and want to keep their innocence for as long as possible. Other crimes such as murder assault and robbery are much more objective they do clear harm and clearly violate anothers right to life their body and their property. So to expand on this. If a year old can give consent to a or something of that sort why then can they not give consent to someone much older? It is because you view it as icky. I will admit in the majority of cases the child is a victim of rape. So clearly if the victim speaks out soon or later the case should be looked into and prosecuted with the right evidence. But it is clear to me that if a yo can give consent to a yo then he can give consent to anyone.On to the next part sex offenders registry is complete bullshit. First of all I fucking hate background checks. They perpetuate poverty and only cause more crime. It makes it hard for criminals to get jobs and they resort back to crimes. On top of that sex offenders are treated so much worse. Why does raping someone adult or child make you so much worse than someone who murdered and didnt get life? It is bullshit. There is the argument but then how would we know if theres a sex offender living next door to my children! Well thats incredibly unfortunate that you dont get to know everyones backgrounds so you can keep your precious little critters safe but that should be your responsibility. People make mistakes but should be able to return to being normal human beings citizens when they do their time. Not to mention that the prison system does not help pedophiles change their ways at all. That needs to change as well.Furthermore the most egregious of these I find is the acceptance on reddit though suprisingly the internet is far better at condemning this than the regular population to pedophiles being beat stabbed and raped in jail. Reddit and chan are actually decent compared to regular society in recognizing that this is fucking insane! It happens way to often. And there is little activism against the abuse sex offenders get in prison or even abuse in general in prison.So I clearly feel very strongly about this youll get bonus points from me if you change my opinion about that last one.

At a child probably hasnt had any sex education in school or from their parents. They arent exposed to sex or adult relationships through childrens media. They cant talk about it with most of their friends. This creates a huge power imbalance in favor of the abuser and a situation thats virtually guaranteed to be exploitative. The other things you mentioned that a child can consent to are normal developmentally appropriate childhood experiences. While many prepubescent children do mastrubate which is considered developmentally normal they do not normally initiate sexual contact with adults or with other children. Thats true even in countries that are far more sexually liberal and open to nudity than the US. Pushing a child to do something before theyre developmentally able tends to have negative behavioral consequences.'},\n",

Generosity is defined as showing a readiness to give more of something as money or time than is strictly necessary or expected. From what I know Id say that in richer circles donating to something andor someone is in fact expected and that you may be perceived badly if you dont donate. Giving above a certain amount can serve as cheap advertising for those donating and serves to increase their reputation with the public. The tax benefits available for those who donate at large amounts can offset the cost of donating and I believe even provide an incentive to give in the first place. There is a line for each person that differs Im sure that below which they are scraping by and above which they do not need to worry about making ends meat or having small luxuries. Someone making in excess of figures certainly lives a very comfortable life even if they cant afford that nd private jet they were drooling over.Lastly Ill put forth what I think is a better way of deciding whom to call generous and whom to not. Make it a rule that unless sacrifice of some sort factors into your gift you are not being generous. Therefore if I donate money to an AIDS research foundation and as a direct result cannot buy the new fancier computer I wanted then I am generous. If a millionaire donates proportionately the same amount but it forces them to change nothing then they are not. The bigger the sacrifice the more generous the person. And yes if a millionaire decides to donate the money they intended to spend on a yacht meaning they dont get a boat or even get a smaller one than what they wanted Id consider that a sacrifice and therefore that they were being generous.I also add that I personally value the gift of time and effort above most monetary gifts because thats something that everyone values about the same. I realize I can be tone deaf when communicating sometimes but I did not mean to imply that not being called generous specifically means you are not doing something good. You absolutely are and clearly those who have more and give very little of it help finance things more than a collective of persons with meager wealth. The point I was initially making was that generous is a very high praise to offer someone and I feel that it can at least sometimes be perceived as a cheap way earning praise for very little. Im reminded of the Biblical story of the woman who gave her last cents in offering and was praised by Jesus as giving more than anyone else. Thats basically the comparison Im making. This view was not in any way meant to comment on how people should receive donationsgifts. Any gift given freely is worth thanking and worthy of praise from the recipient.

We give most of our money away discretely but never anonymously because that is actually a bad thing to do so arent looking for applause but are often called generous.

And nonprofits calling people generous is not only a way of being grateful but more importantly encourages others to do the same.I dont think its really fair to judge people without knowing them. The people I know that give even those who give large amounts and enjoy the publicity give because they care. Sure there are those who buy a girl scout cookie box out of guilt or donate to a shelter to get people to quit bugging them at a fundraiser but for the most part they give because they actually care not because they have to.

Every transaction that you did today that you didnt even notice what you got there was three star service. You deserve three star service. What makes better service better is that you didnt actually deserve it.In a sane world if you get better than acceptable service thats four stars. If you get the best service youve ever seen thats five. If you were disappointed in some way which is clearly attributable to the service provider but you still got moreorless what you wanted thats two stars. If they were completely incompetent and absolutely failed you thats one star. Or zero if they intentionally angered you.However those who decide these things in eBay Uber Walmart Blizzard various American call centres etc etc have all somehow come to the bizarre decision that acceptable should mean five stars and anything less than five stars is unacceptable. I took an Uber ride the other day. I rated the guy five stars for no other reason than that I knew that if I did not he would be punished. He had done nothing wrong. He did exactly what I expected of him. No more no less. He deserved three stars. I wanted to be able to give him that rating without any concern for his continued employment well his contract.This state of affairs completely grinds my gears. It destroys the very purpose of having rating systems at all. It converts the rating system back to a binary badgood with no meaningful distinction between those ratings. Worse it makes no actual provision for recognition of genuinely good service. If you rate any seller who sent the thing out in acceptable condition within acceptable time as five star how do you fairly rate the one who sent it out quicker than you expected better packed and the item in better condition than you were told? How do you rate the Uber driver who showed up early got you to your destination quickly and had a great conversation with you?Am I wrong? Have I missed something here?',\n",
       "  'counters': 'Youre arguments biggest problem is a lack of a causal link. Your thesis is that fivestar rating systems drive things towards a binary goodbad system. But IMO everything youve argued applies equally to a four star system. When I rate things on a four star system I have the same thinking. I only give less than four stars for something that is procedurally or substantively defective in some way. In fact Id argue that with more stars Im less reluctant to give less than perfect. With a fivestar system four stars still looks like really good service to me. But three stars seems less so and makes me want to give three and a half. I dont think itd be possible to get people to adhere to one system of rating things. Some people will never rate less than a perfect score and others will be really picky. But I dont really see anything that implies a star system encourages a badgood system more than a star system does. In fact as Ive argued Id think that the bigger the range of numbers the less apprehensive a person will be about giving their true opinion this is used in many scientific studies more recently too. A system can give very different results from a test I would argue that the true creation of the binary system comes from the fact that people dont care enough to spend time thinking about what rating a sellerbuyer actually deserves. Because of this the norm becomes stars. Furthermore companies like Ebay see this and thus set the bar at stars.'},\n",

One famous example of an affirmative defense was the burning bed case where a battered woman essentially lost her mind and burned up her abusive husband while he slept.

So while she faced consequences for her actions the jury decided that she was not of sound mind at the time and therefore not responsible.Prosecutors generally have a fair amount of discretion when deciding whether to bring charges against an individual for criminal actions. They must weigh the cost of a trial against the probable outcome based on the strength of their case.

I live with my husband on the edge of the wealthy part of town in an inexpensive but extremelywellkept apartment complex. To the north of us are designer stores sprawling mansions spas country clubs and organic groceries. To the south of us are much more ordinary neighborhoods. My husband works for my father and makes approximately dollars a week after tax. I dont work. Im a fulltime student and my uppermiddleclass parents pay for the entirety of my education. Id say were doing quite well for ourselves especially having only been married a year ago. I wouldnt consider myself to be rich or upper middle class but I enjoy the finer things in life like designer clothes and very expensive scotch. I just watched a documentary called Seperate yet Unequal about a Louisiana city district trying to break off its wealthier half of the city and create a new gentrified city. Advocates of the plan to split off said it meant better schools and a better life in general for the new citys citizens. I was rooting for those who wanted the new city instead of being horrified. I like gentrification it means Starbucks and decent shopping malls. It means less ghettos and thugs and crime. Those who opposed it talked about the fact that poor people would be left behind in the old city. Cant the old city just have construction projects to make things nice and shiny and new? Apartment complexes can start refurbishing projects and suburbs can have contests for who can DIY their house to look the nicest. Stores and shop owners can clean up a little better and the city itself can have a recycling program or a treeplanting program or something. Itll only become a second Detroit if the citizens allow it to.The citizens of the old city can live on the fringes of the new one like my husband and I do. Technically speaking were not in the rich part of town but because of its very close proximity our apartments are just as wellkept as the expensive villas a neighborhood over. We have our own clubhouse gym pool and all the luxury amenities are within walking distance. Luxury living at ghetto prices! Problem solved!...Right? Am I missing something here? The people in the documentary seemed outraged as though this wasnt something they knew how to fix. I dont understand. Please help me understand their point of view. Maybe youll in the process.',\n",
       "  'counters': 'The old city doesnt have the money to make things shiny and new because their tax base is pretty poor. Theyre probably more preoccupied by paying for things like better public transport and youth support programs rather than spending money on building new things that will be pretty. The poor people are poor in the sense that they lack both time and money. Its funny that you mention that you go to school and dont work because that implies you have the free time to do some DIY projects. Now imagine if youre a fulltime student who works parttime to pay tuition. Where has your free time gone? Youll probably return home exhausted and have to do your readings. When thats the case its hard to take on a longterm project like bettering your neighbourhood. Ghettos and thugs and crime do not disappear with gentrification. They just wont happen in front of the rich peoples eyes and instead are concentrated in poorer areas effectively making them less desirable. I think its interesting that you mention cleaning up areas on your own dime and time to make them nicer. Unfortunately living in a nicer area literally means living in a more expensive area in our current social paradigm. Even if the poor people have the time and money and resources to invest in this neighbourhood whos going to want to move to an area that has nice flowers and trees with some edgy lowerclass charm? Rich people. And gentrification starts again! Thats the thing its not like new city and old city will be divided and gentrification stops there. If parts of the old city becomes desirable and nicer for some reason prices will go up and people will be once again relocated. Lastly there is less demand for decent shopping malls and Starbucks and other luxury amenities in the old city because thats not what people want. When my family first immigrated to Canada our neighbourhood had no Starbucks or nice restaurants or nice malls because even if it did we wouldnt have been able to afford going there anyway. What poor people miss about the new city is that a its probably where they work and b its a more peaceful environment that probably has better schools for their kids. The Starbucks and nice malls and terraces arent the attractive parts. With all due respect I dont think you and your husband are living in an area that most displaced people can afford and certainly not at ghetto prices. To put it bluntly after tax per month for two people with no crippling debt like student loans is not what displaced people earn especially considering that many families have multiple children i.e. dependents. With gentrification those families may have to travel further accumulating more costs and less time to make their neighbourhood better while earning the same amount of money if they get to keep their jobs at all.'},\n",

Even if the residents are well behaved there is going to be traffic of their friends who Im assuming will be similar in nature. The company wont say who may be living there.

I dont exactly know what that means but I assume that they wont be paying property taxes. That means that they will be consuming resources but not paying for them and my share of the community taxes will increase..

I know this is considered tabboo to many people but here are my views Why I prefer welldone steak First of all by well done I mean brown all the way through which is not the same as completely burned so that the steak resembles a hockey puck in appearance and flavor. I have had some phenomenal steaks cooked well done at moderatetoupscale steakhouses and the outside was barely charred at all. After trying steaks cooked to a variety of temperatures I feel that well done is the best according to my tastes. I dont feel that the flavor is substantially lost by cooking the steak for longer. Of course each temperature has its own distinct flavor but I do not feel that a properly prepared welldone steak sacrifices much if any flavor. The same goes for texture if prepared properly. That said in general I prefer my food cooked all the way through. When I cut into a rare steak and am greeted with a brightred gush of raw beef and bloodlike juice I completely lose my appetite. Presentation is important when eating such an expensive meal. Finally a fully cooked steak reduces the probability of picking up a foodborne illness. So its a win anyway you cut it pardon the pun. Why there shouldnt be a stigma around ordering welldone steak First of all Im the customer and its my money. I have heard that some restaurants not all obviously might give you a worse cut of meat if you ask for it cooked welldone. This is unreasonable and contrary to the spirit of a clientfocused food service industry where the customer orders and pays for a meal and the restaurant delivers. If restaurants or chefs are unwilling to start with the same quality ingredients for all orders regardless of specific customer requests then they should expressly forbid such orders on the menu so that customers with particular preferences can choose to dine elsewhere. I used to work in a restaurant not a steakhouse though and am never adversarial towards a server so I should expect the same when I am a customer.',\n",

Lower quality cuts matter less.As a general rule steaks should be cooked anywhere from rare to medium certainly showing some pink or red. The main reason youll find is indeed the taste. Its almost certainly a personal thing for you but the fact does remain the more you cook a steak the more flavor it will lose. A blue steak has the most flavor you will eat and is also equally the toughest. The more you cook the meat the more flavor you are sacrificing. At upscale places you are paying a lot for a good cut of meat and it is considered a waste of money to more or less cook away the taste of the meat.In my personal experience another reason for it is often the complimentary wines that steaks go well with. At a highend steak house every steak will be recommended with some wines and recommended to be cooked a certain way so the whole meal works. Most people who enjoy steak prefer it cooked medium or less and so you can throw off an entire dish by cooking it differently.Now I completely agree on the count no restaurant should refuse you or give you lower quality steak for this. However you will find a deal of social stigma around ordering the steak like this and I believe that to be somewhat warranted though only in a mockserious manner.

       "  'arguments': 'The success we keep hearing about in private schools is overhyped. Instead of privatizing education we should be focusing on how to reform the public system.I went to private schools all my life. I still go to one. The endless tales of bad teachers that we hear about in public schools can be accompanied by an equally long list of bad private school teachers.Let add to the pot of bad teacher storiesIn th grade I had trouble writing. The private school my parents paid well over year in tuition couldnt even tell me what was wrong. When we changed schools we found out what the issue was.When I was in th grade my math teacher moved to fast for me. I had to take an extra class from the learning support specialist which was effectively my math class. I also had to take a Christian studies course. When I asked the teacher questions such as If God is omnipresent why is he spaceless and timeless? I was given a vague answer. Any student who asked a hard question was given an unhelpful answer though that might be a problem with religion rather than with private schools. It wasnt an honest and objective analysis of Christianity rather it was a circlejerk of God is Great! Or Praise Jesus! I couldve used that time more effectively with the learning support specialist.In th grade my math teacher was incompetent beyond words. Literally all the parents and students hated her. The only reason that amalgamation of cells was ever hired was because school policy required that both the husband and wife be employees at the school. She started off each morning with a prayer which she couldve used as time to help struggling students. Instead of helping struggling students she would talk about her kids proselytize during class or make us ask our peers. She also made me take a test when I was jetlagged. Again the learning support specialist had to pick up the slack. Then theres my personal favorite of these stories from her she made the Asian kids teach for her. Funny thing is we couldve been spared from her. There was an applicant whose qualifications went beyond an accounting degree and having an SO who got a job at the same establishment. The reason he wasnt hired? He was agnostic. Instead of caring about the students the school cared about an agenda.I had to take that Christian studies course again in th grade and we were shown a video from Ben Steins Expelled and they contested evolution in that class. Im okay with the Bible being taught as mythology but to challenge scientific fact is utter bullshit. In my th grade year there a someone in my grade whose parents were getting a divorce. He became depressed. The school which practically made us memorize the sermon on the mount decided that the most Christlike action possible was to suspend him. What good what that have done? He wouldve been brought closer to the divorce. The divorce is what made him depressed in the first place. Thats what Jesus would do? I think what Jesus would do is get the hell away from the school campus.In my th grade year there was a band teacher who had an ego bigger than Mount Everest. He made all the band students play in his goodbye concert. There was one kid who had to attend a funeral which happened to be on the same day as the ego concert. This guys Christlike action? He threatened to FAIL the kid if he didnt go to the concert. Through all these examples Ive shown that teachers can be just as incompetent and egotistical as public school teachers. Whatever bureaucracy plagues public schools can be replaced by even worse teaching standards.',\n",

       "  'arguments': 'It is natural for people to be averse to the idea of eugenics. The belief that some people constitute better biological stock than others is hard to swallow we do not choose our genes and none of us like the idea of choices being made by others for our own supposed benefit. We believe that we have a right to reproduce a right to bodily autonomy that precludes government control of reproduction. Our individualist society places ultimate worth in the individual no matter how beneficial something may be for the collective it is wrong if it infringes on the rights of the individual. This is faulty reasoning and an indication that we are out of touch with reality. The individual does not exist we are continuously and overwhelmingly shaped by external forces outside of our control our genetic code our upbringing in childhood the societies in which we live. In turn our actions shape the genetic makeup of the future shape the future families and societies. This being realized it is clear that to place the individual above all else is to suppose that each individuals selfinterested actions will eventually benefit the collective as a whole. Adam Smith called this the invisible hand Of course Smith was referring solely to economic growth patterns which are not necessarily good indicators of true progress. One need only comprehend the devastation wrought upon the Earth as a consequences of the Industrial Revolution to see that economic growth may not be a good thing after all.Throughout history we have been shown that in a competitive individualized society that to which we are all entitled quickly becomes degraded Which brings me to my point something to which every individual feels entitled is the production of children. We shudder at the thought of someone other than ourselves controlling our prospective children. We can see no reason for another entity to restrict our ability to reproduce. However such reasons do exist and they are quite powerful. Among these are. The introduction of a child into the world is a fundamentally violent action. Parents do not ask for consent when they have children they are forcing the world to accommodate the presence of their child. All parents hope that their children will become self sufficient and ultimately benefit the world around them but clearly this is not the case.. It has long been known that less intelligent people have more children This inverse relationship between IQ and fertility has worried scientists since industrialization in the th century. It has been shown that IQ is largely heritable gt with the conclusion being that the Flynn Effect is a phenotypic consequence of better nutrition that masks our steady downward spiral of genotypic intelligence. Not only are less intelligent people predisposed towards having more children but our society encourages diversion from intellectual pursuits. The explosion of mass media and popular culture is very troubling the average American spends hours a day watching television We have entered an age where selection for beneficial traits has reached an all time low and so has selection against deleterious traits. Plastic surgery infertility treatment deodorant simple and repetitive jobs the welfare state makeup and fashion lack of disease and natural predators the list goes on. Now more than ever there exist a multitude of forces that accommodate genetic weakness and allow these individuals to reproduce with the same vigor as those who are more genetically fit.. The world is experiencing a real crisis of of overpopulation and consequential deterioration of the natural and built environment. It is said that education will lead to lower fertility of course I agree with this! And that is precisely the problem the educated and intelligent people decide to have fewer children. Those who are unintelligent either through lack of education or lack of aptitude will always have more children if it is in their self interest to do so. The potential economic worth of a child is hard to overstate when one is living in poverty.To summarize my points I believe that when an individual makes their contribution to the gene pool of the future by reproducing they are perpetuating their own genetic deficiencies to the detriment of not only their descendants but those who will live with their descendants. Note that I would never suggest that genetically weak people be killed. They deserve all the compassion that we should grant to any individual. It is this compassion that I feel towards future unborn individuals that leads me to believe that eugenics is necessary. Human civilization has reached a point where natural selection no longer favors intelligent cooperative sociable and moral individuals. It is a world where anonymity and division of labor have enabled the potential for everyone to survive and have children. But such survival is not thriving! The value of a population is measured in its quality not its quantity. With dysgenic freereproduction there is very little that encourages high quality low quantity births and very little that discourages low quality high quantity births.As to how such eugenic goals may be realized I point to China for inspiration Incentives for individuals to have few children is the first step. Once the total birthrate has become low enough to maintain a stable population measures can be taken to improve genetic structure of future born children. These might involve extensive sperm amp eggs banks where individuals identified as genetically fit i.e. high IQ noncriminal genuinely altruistic physically wellformedhealthy could supply the majority of new children. People on the lower end of the genetic spectrum could still raise children provided they pass certain testsbackground checks ensuring that they will not be abusive and corrupting. I propose all people pass these tests to qualify as adoptive parents even genetically fit individualsI foresee that responses will suggest that I am placing too much concern on heredity that is I am giving undue weight to nature over nurture. To this I contend that we often underestimate the power of heredity. Of course all humans share common ancestors if you go back far enough. It is generally accepted that we all came from the same initial genetic stock But the reality is that our physical manifestation is determined mostly by the genetic structures of our parents and our environment in the womb infancy and early childhood. Our brains are physical organs whose physical form is determined almost entirely by genes. People have long recognized the importance of the brain and many attempted to physically deform the brain for mystical or social reasons. Heredity is recognized as the major determining component in intelligence among other behavioral aspects If you wish to change my view you will have to convince me that. Dysgenic collapse is not only not imminent but impossible. I see no difference between it happening years from now or a thousand or even a million. The threat of its occurrence must be dealt with at some point. . Individualist and free society where no government oversight over reproduction exists can counter dysgenic trends of its own accord. Show me that people are willing to embrace technology that will rewrite the genetic codes of fetuses rendering concerted naturalreproduction eugenicist efforts unnecessary. . That a future with dysgenic collapse a la Idiocracy is not necessarily a bad thing so long as an elite exists that will take care of the unwittingly enslaved humans.I look forward to seeing some responses soon.',\n",
       "  'counters': 'Ignoring the ethical issues Im skeptical that eugenics is even possible from a logistics standpoint.Humans are a terrible candidate for any sort of selective breeding at least by other humans.Most of our domesticated species have generation times of less than three years. For those that dont certain fruit trees mainly we can cheat by using techniques such as grafting. A single human can see dozens of generations in their lifetime enough to effect some major change. The Russian Silver Fox domestication experiment for example took about forty years and generations of extremely intensive selection only letting the top of males and of females breed to bring a single trait tameness to a prevalence in the population. Not perfect by any means but a fairly major difference from wildtype.Humans though have a generation time an order of magnitude longer usually somewhere around years depending on culture. To achieve results similar to what was seen with the foxes were looking at something like or a thousand years.Initiating a selective breeding program for humans then would require not only that a dedicated and invasive bureaucratic apparatus with rigorous recordkeeping and incredibly broad authority be created but that it exist in a largely unchanged state for significantly longer than the lifespan of most continuous governments. Also on an unrelated note gene therapy isnt limited to fetuses heres a case where it was used to cure hereditary colour blindness in adult monkeys. It seems to me that as far as mucking around with the genes of human beings goes we ought to be prioritizing the development and refinement of such in vivo genetic modification over conventional eugenics and the creation of designer babies. For one it provides an immediate benefit to the already living whereas the other two techniques can only benefit the unborn and for another it allows for at least the initial beneficiary to give full informed consent to the modification of their genome and to select traits that they personally find desirable.'},\n",

For future reference a good place to go if you have economic curiosities is rAskSocialScience which actually does have econs Basic Income comes in two flavors conditional and unconditional. Conditional basic income is means tested such that only some of the population receive it and how much they receive is based on income. Unconditional simply sends everyone a check for the same amount irrespective of income.Unconditional gets much of the time on reddit but is extraordinarily poorly supported in advanced economies its incredibly expensive the distortionary effects from increasing taxation to pay for it would counteract its economic benefits many times over would have a huge labor discouragement issue and would cause significant inflationary problems. Unconditional basic income in an advanced economy would eviscerate economic growth without correcting many of the problems those who support it claim. In developing economies it is well supported and through projects such as the Namibian Basic Income Experiment has been shown to be extraordinarily positive for both social amp economic indicators in these cases.Conditional has been subject to about a dozen experiments in advanced economies including four in the US is extremely strongly supported by economists and would have a strong positive effect on economic amp social outcomes. Here are some points you may not have considered CBI would effectively eliminate poverty in the US. Crime would drop substantially health outcomes would increase educational outcomes would increase social participation would increase etc. Its impossible to understate how profound an impact this would have on society and everyone in it. This would lower spending in other areas particularly justice. CBI would correct the lack of mobility between lowincome and middleincome families. Currently mobility remains strong and mostly flat for the last several decades between middleincome and highincome families but poverty and the systems we have in place to manage it result in a poverty trap problem where its extraordinarily difficult for those in poverty to work themselves out of it. Likewise generational mobility suffers the same problem those born in to poverty are far more likely to remain in poverty throughout their lives then they should be. CBI would actually save money. While UBI is very expensive at least .t over baseline CBI costs less then the programs it replaces as it has almost no administration overhead its managed via the tax system. The saving is not expected to be particularly statistically significant b but when you also consider the increase in growth and wages as a result of CBI the end result is more substantial you would still pay the same rate of tax and federal spending would remain about the same but your pay would increase. CBI is extraordinarily progressive. The US already has the most progressive income tax in the world due to the EITC a much smaller form of CBI and a full scale CBI would mean the entire tax system would become the most progressive in the world by a very significant margin. UBI is not progressive it is flat. In regards to your education point CBI makes it easier to enter education. Someone can choose to work part time while going to school rather then never being able to afford to go as they have to work full time to afford to live. CBI would result in immediate full employment. One key piece of CBI is removing the MW so that everyone has opportunity to enter the labor market even if they dont have the skills to justify the artificial wage floor. CBI would have a profoundly positive impact on lowincome wages. Currently lowincome labor cannot choose to withhold labor if they disagree with wages they still need to be able to afford to live. CBI would result in a significant improvement in wages and working conditions for lowincome labor.Ideologically I am too opposed to simply handing people others money but this is a case where doing so actually benefits me and you economically consider it like an investment rather then simply giving it away.

There are many reasons why there is no simple or feasible way to standardize english.First of all there are dozens of dialects of english. You mentioned british and american english but the fact of the matter is you are barely scratching the surface with those. To be honest those two dialects are a lot more similar to each other than most english dialects are. Heck africanamerican vernacular english has its own separate grammar. So the idea of ever standardizing english would be an incredibly difficult task that would also cause issues in terms of ethics. Because people probably wouldnt take to kindly to being told that their form of english is incorrect. So heres the other issue. What youre talking about is an issue with prescriptive english. Prescriptive basically meaning that these would be the rules of english that would be enforced. Unfortunately descriptive the way people actually speak and write language never perfectly matches up with the prescriptive side. And from a linguistic standpoint theres nothing wrong with this because as long as people are able to communicate effectively there really isnt any reason why prescriptive rules need to be followed. If someone tells you they aint got no milk you still understand that they mean they dont have any milk. In saying this they would be breaking the prescriptive rule of no double negatives but from a descriptive standpoint there is no issue. So lets say you changed the school curriculums to all use the same standardized spelling. People who learned before the switch in those respective countries would continue using the old spelling and thus the new students would still be exposed to the old spelling in their day to day lives. So all in all not much would change. So thats why realistically this change is impossible. As for professors and employers wanting different spellings well. I dont know if that is really relevant considering they probably have a long list of other requirements that may not be agreed upon by the masses either. Some professors want documents handed in to them in point font typed in times new roman. Im sure you wouldnt complain if you handed in an essay typed in pt. comic sans and they docked marks for it.

Lengthy story there just to say many teenagers cannot put complete trust in what their parents say. Parents are just bigger kids raising kids. Its unfortunate but sometimes teenagers have to trust in their own ability They have to make choices for themselves. Parents should be there to help their child if they fall down in their pursuit to find whats right for them in life.Now to argue the point in America there are many religious people that think its wrong for their children to have sex. So theyll cut off education and access to contraceptives as well as organizations such as Planned Parenthood.

As a species were at a point where we depend on the environment for survival. Therefore the environment has utility. The environment also has aesthetic value for most people.. Is there a moral obligation to sustain the environment?No. This is a whole different but I dont think morality is the ideal method of determining whether or not a populationsociety should do anything. On an individual basis morality is useful but it has extreme subjectivity. I feel that although not perfect utility is often the more reliable system for societies. No system of value will avoid subjectivity and all can be twisted in the same way.. My point.I use the word necessarily in the title because if the solutions we develop allow us to continue to exploit the environment in order to support the growth of our species then so be it. I dont believe however that the environment on Earth will be able to support the growth of humanity indefinitely. Therefore a more ideal solution is to create synthetic solutions.

       "  'counters': 'I have been homeless three times now and I assure you that almost nobody is homeless by choice.Its all about resource management.You see each homeless person realized one day that he was unable to come up with the money needed for everything. Each story is different but the thing most of those stories have in common is the realization that you can live in a car but you cant drive an apartment.So the first stage of homelessness is typically couch surfing with friends or family. But for those who cant for whatever reason do that well they end up living out of their cars. And even the couch surfers generally end up at Camp Toyota after a short period of time anyway.Theyre homeless though they often still have jobs.You might not even realize theyre homeless. In fact I dare say you know at least one homeless person and dont have the slightest clue theyre homeless.But living out of your car is difficult. You have to hide the fact that youre living in your car because it is not generally allowed. That means that you have to go to sleep very late each night. It also means you have to spend a significant amount of time finding somewhere to use the bathroom and to shower. Oh yeah and you dont get very restful sleep in your car.So even if you have a job to begin with youre starting to look a bit haggard after a short period of time. You havent slept. Youre struggling to keep yourself presentable but showers are hard to come by. You dont have a bathroom mirror at your disposal.And by now your employer is becoming less and less happy with you.Oh sure youre really trying to hold it together but damn everything is so much harder now. And sometimes it takes months before you lose that job but youre going to lose it. After all youve been working as well as spending several hours per day just trying to find somewhere to shit.And everything costs far more when youre homeless. You cant cook so every meal is at a restaurant. You might as I did move into a hotel. But that eats up pretty much your whole paycheck I did this for years.And at this point absolutely anything that goes wrong is catastrophic.The day you lose your job youre pretty much hosed.Now you dont have the means to do laundry. Or shower. So you have a very short window in which you might pick up another job. If you miss that window youre not likely to bounce back without anybodys help.But you dont know that yet.Youre still hopeful and you keep trying.But eventually you figure out that its pretty easy to get enough to get by dollar menu items a pack of cigarettes maybe a bottle of beer. Yeah the cigarettes and beer may seem wasteful to somebody with somewhere to sleep but its not like you had a choice between having a home and smoking. You had a choice between a value meal and a pack of cigarettes and two McDoubles.And heaven forbid someone jacks your ID.If you find yourself without an ID the world just got very narrow for you. You cant even do day labor which btw is how many homeless people get by. Theyre working but not every day because its pointless to work every day on three hours of uneasy sleep at Camp Toyota.And somewhere around this time your car insurance lapses.So now your home your car is in constant jeopardy. The first time you get pulled over your home is history. Oh sure theyll let you go to the impound yard to collect your belongings but youre leaving on foot.With everything you own on your back.How open are potential employers to hiring you? Precisely equal to the average persons willingness to help you out with cash at nearly zero.Once youve reached the point that people can tell youre homeless aint nobody giving you a job. Well maybe. But its not likely. When you see someone who has been reduced to the point of begging youre not looking at someone who doesnt want to work have a home clothes fresh food and someone to love. Youre seeing someone who has so many roadblocks standing before him that for right now if he can get a sandwich and a bottle of beer or coca cola he can relax for a few hours.When I have money and a homeless person begs for some of it I reach in my pocket and grab one bill and immediately hand it over without looking at it. Sometimes it has been a bill and it has stung a little bit to hand it over.Whenever they say something like I promise Im going to spend this on food I always tell them that its none of my business what they spend their money on.I cant give them a home but I can give them a fleeting moment of dignity the first thing they lost when they started circling the drain.'},\n",

       "  'counters': 'Since you asked for specific annecdotesI know one homeless person. He lives in my city attends my church and regularly begs at the same place in a mall for most of the year. Hes clean relatively speaking keeps himself groomed and wears a suit pretty much every day. He sleeps on the street and not in a shelter yearround because he likes to have a bit of alcohol before bed and shelters wont allow him to do that. He gets harrassed by police and occasionally arrested for hanging out in malls after theyve closed and sneaking into warm places where he shouldnt be. Meeting him has been fairly eyeopening to me. He definitely has experienced some significant trauma in his life and I dont know what level of mental illness exists with him but he was definitely an ok functioning person for part of his life. He has some days where hes completely off the wall and I just look at him and think where the hell is his mind at? and other days he is almost perfectly lucid. Well relatively speaking.On the lucid days I get a bit of history from him. He grew up in the same city I did played music had a crappy apartment traveled. Theres a gap though after that that hes never talked about. Other days he discusses how his week went. One week his prayer item for church was praise because he was going to buy two shirts for from someone and then when he went the guy only would sell him one but then he found another shirt on his way home. From time to time hell just sit there healing from frostbite or nursing a new cut from some trouble he got in. Rarely is he completely out of control but almost just as rarely is he ever seeming fully in control either. From time to time he quotes scriptures from memory but mostly what he quotes is absolutely incomprehensible. I have come to a place where I dont really have a solution for him. He doesnt want help which really frustrates certain people at our church he gets enough from begging to more or less buy himself some food keep himself clothed and get some booze but he isnt a constant drunk nor is he making anywhere near what hed get if he were employed. He has a life going on he is at church every week he takes a bath beforehand and gets a new pair of socks we make sure hes fed and see if he has any urgent needs he has a group of friends who live on the street that he knows and who take care of each other he meets up with a couple people a week who buy him a hot meal and chat with him when thats possible. He adds something to our community. He brings in a completely different perspective another side of life that we often overlook or pretend doesnt exist. We like to think that given enough resources we could save everyone or that we could figure out how to bring them out of misery or just buy a happy life for everyone. But really there are a lot of people who are suffering in many ways that we cant even really comprehend. I think that theres value there and I think the people who embody that the homeless the vagrants and the lost are helpful at recalling to us that we are all broken and that theres a great need for grace in our interactions not only with them but with all people whos choices we dont agree with and ultimately with each person we meet.'},\n",

       "  'counters': 'The problem with the points you listed aside from the obsolescence one is that for the majority of smart phone users they arent issues. The majority of iPhone users dont want to customize their icons or home screens or device settings. Messing around with these options can easily create inconsistencies within your phone leading to crashes confusing errors and visual incongruence. Most people I know with an iPhone dont care about customizing their phones past wallpapers or ring tones. You may want to customize the individual settings of your phone but that doesnt mean the lack of this capability on an iPhone makes it worthless.Next haptic feedback. Sure you may want it on your phone but just because you see it as something that almost always needs to be on a device when I buy it doesnt mean that others should feel this way. I had an iPhone for almost years before I switched to an HTC One for the customization actually and I got along just fine without haptic feedback. Now price. I cant really understand this complaintfrom what Ive observed the majority of people who buy cellphones do so on contract. On contract iPhones are priced exactly the same as leading Android phones. High offcontract prices scare away potential customers leading to increased upgrade sales.Oh and dont act like Android phones arent the exact same price. An HTC One M is . Now obsolescence thats actually a good point. But something Ive found that members of the tech community often fail to understand is that normal people with no interest in technology and money to spend dont really care about these things. They want the new phone as a status symbola sign that they are at least moderately with it. Both outside of and inside of America iPhones are cultural touchstones that show a person is relatively up to the times. They are recognizable ubiquitous and cool. I cant count the number of times people have asked whether or not my HTC One is a galaxy or even asked me whether or not it is a phone. People know what an iPhone is and the majority of the people in this world dont care about Snapdragon CPUs or Tasker or anything else that Android phones offer. They want what everyone else has and at least in America thats an iPhone.Now having been a recent convert to Android I can offer some things that iPhones provide that Android conspicuously lacks though this may improve. Seamless integration with computers. When you plug an iPhone into a Mac iTunes pops up and immediately begins syncing your information and apps. Sure HTC has HTC Sync and Im sure Samsung has their own program but iTunes is already on your computer. It already plays your music. Its ubiquitous relatively bugfree and simple to use. Dont try to tell me that Titanium Backup or HTC Sync is anywhere near as hasslefree as an iTunes backup because its not and you know it. Apple Stores. Break your phone bring it in to a store and get it fixed. Easy. You dont need to send away to a far off factory you dont need to deal with carrier support you dont even need to backup your phone in some instances. Apple makes it ridiculously simple to be and stay their customer. Ubiquity. Now this doesnt really seem like a fair point but let me prove it to you. Its always better to have what everyone else has when it comes to technology. Support is easier compatibility is better and more apps come out for your device. Ever try to use a small banks Android or even worse Android Tablet app? Companies without technology budgets dont put effort into a category of phones that doesnt represent the majority.I like to think of iPhones as a walledin garden and Android phones as a vast plain ripe for homesteading. With iPhones you know exactly what youre gettinggood battery life good camera great compatibility and unfathomably good support if you live near an Apple store. Everything is perfect and manicured because the guy who owns the garden only has about four or five gardens to worry about.Android homesteaders are lack the safety and security of this garden. But with this opportunity comes dangeryou can easily crash your phone download too many conflicting apps or get the wrong icon pack and end up with a screen full of little green android men. But if youre smart enough there are majestic peaks and valleys lying across the plain. You just have to be clever enough to get there with your sanity intact.TLDR Most people dont give two shits about customization and haptic feedback. They a phone that will get them through the day and a guy to come running to when its not working anymore. iPhones offer that service perfectly and Android does not.

       "  'arguments': 'I am proposing that New York be split into two states to ensure political fairness and to lower taxes in the northern region. Under this proposal the northern and southern portions of New York would be separated. Long Island New York City the boroughs Queens Brooklyn the Bronx Manhattan and Staten Island and Westchester County would belong to one state whereas all NY counties north of Westchester would be considered another. Albany would remain the capital of the northern region and Manhattan would become the capital of the southern state.The state of New York is considered to be a blue state. However one may find that the geographic majority of New York is actually conservative. While New York being considered a blue state accounts for the majority of the people living in it it excludes the vast geographic majority. This is due to the fact that southern New York is very population dense. There are . million people living in the state of New York. . million people live in New York City . million people on Long Island and a little over people living in Westchester County. This means that out of the . million people in the state . million people make up a region of square miles NY as a whole minus the regions I described above. The liberal south of the state is deciding how the many conservative areas are run. A resident of Long Island or NYC may find it dangerous and unnecessary to own a gun. However youre likely to find signs that blatantly oppose the New York S.A.F.E Act The political atmosphere of the geographic majority of New York is very different from that of the populous majority. Dividing the state in two would allow for the two regions to make political decisions that respect their populations. Currently the rich liberals in New York City and its surrounding areas neglect the rest of the state. This would not be an issue if decisions made in Albany the state capital affected the nearby counties and not those hours away with a different atmosphere and different views. The different areas have different needs lets serve them better.Taxes are also high in New York as is the cost of living. This once again is likely due to the fact that the standard of living in most of New York City Long Island and Westchester is ridiculously high. In Westchester and Long Island you have your stereotypical white uppermiddle class picketfence families. In New York City you have the city that never sleeps a global economic driving force. As a result people in the more rural parts of New York face harsh taxes since these people make up a majority of the state. By isolating the people of the southern region the northerners would pay reasonable taxes while the southerners would pay appropriate taxes. Those who cant afford it or those who choose to pay lower taxes may want to move to the northern state. I believe that the northern regions economy could be managed with the help of metropolitan areas such as Albany Syracuse Utica Buffalo and Ithaca. There are also many universities in these areas many public schools and more than enough private schools that would continue to stimulate the economy. The southern region would have no problem sustaining itself. But I could be completely wrong. .',\n",
       "  'counters': 'As a Chicagoan the points you illustrate are very familiar. Every few years we have politicians in Southern and Central Illinois calling for a separate state from Chicago. From back to there have been people dragging this issue out. The problem is that it does not reflect the nature of democracy and the vital economic relationship between the two areas.You could replace Illinois and Chicago for New York and NYC. For a little background Illinois is a blue state that should be a red state if you look at it geographically. Central and Southern Illinois feel like entirely different states complete with different accents economies and politics. By geographycounties the state votes primarily Republican. It is a sea of red except for Cook East St. Louis and some other urban counties. While it appears unfair on its face for such a small area to dictate policy around of the state lives in Chicago alone and if you include the Chicago suburbs from which many people commute and are influenced by Chicago the number rises to . Within Chicago are numerous fortune companies international airports and various economic and travel hubs that anchor the entire Midwest. In essence it is by far the economic provider for Illinois. While our views on issues and what should be priorities are very different from the rest of the state that is the nature of politics. If we start segregating states on politics and issues it would be difficult to draw the line of where to stop. If you create a new state of simply North New York you are now disenfranchising the Democrats that live there and agree with the policies that were set by a unified New York. By your argument cities should be their own entities since they can best serve their populations. The interests of people in Albany would be different from the interests of people in Bath. While both are in the North why shouldnt they be in different states themselves? The problem is that theres no way to draw the line once you start down that road. Eventually you have to tell someone that your idea for running the state is better even if it adversely affects them. We can go macro too and ask why not let the Southern US or all red states in general secede out of political fairness. It does suck and I have many friends in downstate Illinois who hate Chicago because of the amount of influence it has. But when you influence the majority you influence policy. As it stands this is political fairness because everyone has a vote and is equal in representation. The majority dictates policy and it just happens that Republicans are in the minority. While the political minority will not like it not everyone can win. If representation were based on real property land instead of persons then it would be unfair.The tax issues would not be fixed by splitting the state but would instead be exacerbated. As you stated the North has many universities. I imagine comparing it to Illinois it has many state parks prisons and public works as well. When you remove NYC from the state you lose ALL of that tax revenue and income from NYC for those public things. Universities are extremely expensive and you cannot guarantee that the students will not move to NYC after. By removing NYC you remove their duty to shoulder the burden but they retain the benefits of having college educated students move there. People will still work in NYC since it is the economic hub of the US and splitting the state will not increase the retention rate of students. This is why the Chicago secession proposals are always dismissed. The state thrives off of the big cities. Removing NYC will not increase the economic production of Albany or Syracuse. Instead the state will have to raise taxes to account for the lost revenue or start cutting back on universities prisons parks and other public functions. Gradually the cities will grow and provide a stable economy but you will find that you are in the same place again as the cities become the population hubs and therefore dictate policy to the rest of the state.'},\n",

Also both women and man in order to have attractive bodies and faces dont only need to satisfy the minimum of decent weight.

Length of legs compared to torso width of shoulders hips to waist... have a body that is well proportioned and let it be pounds under or pounds overweight no muscle and it will still look infinitely better than the poorly proportioned body that is perfectly fit.Same with faces women can put make up take care to have perfect skin etc but bad proportions cant be covered like a zit can. Therefore I would say it is equally hard but one point going back to your post and men being muscular can be interpreted in two ways. Like I said me and tons of girls I know dont like muscular men at all and like thin. I even know girls who love a little beer belly. In my experience men are more uniform in what they find attractive and personal preferences are about very little hair color for example or boobs a bit bigger or smaller which doesnt make much difference. Women are all over the place with the types. There are def men no women and men many women find attractive but there are tons who are ideal to some and totally unattractive to other. The biggest difference is really the size and manly vs non manly types. Id say about half of women prefer very pretty thin men and are grossed out by overly many looks muscle beard etc. The other half want very manly looks.This point can mean it is easier for men since many of them are likely to be some womens type and they dont have to satisfy one clear standard. On the other hand it can make it harder because they dont have a clear goal of how to look to be attractive. They can work on muscle just to find the girl they like isnt into muscular men and that is hardy an unusual scenario.'},\n",

       "  'counters': 'Irony generally describes a situation in which a certain action is taken which results in the direct opposite of your expectations occurring. There are quite a few examples in the song which do not seem ironic at all in my opinion An old man turned ninetyeightHe won the lottery and died the next day Winning the lottery does not carry the expectation of directly increasing your lifespan the action and result are not related. Moreover the man was quite old already so it is not an unexpected outcome that he died.Its a black fly in your Chardonnay This situation might be unexpected but it is not ironic. There is no direct expectation that there will never be a fly in your drink. The issue of flies in a drink is generally not a conscious concern for people drinking alcohol.Its like rain on your wedding day Your explanation for this line was that it was an example of situational irony because women tend to plan their weddings meticulously and have an expectation of control. However I think you are reading too much into this solitary verse. Morisette does not mention a woman instead using your or that the wedding had been planned explicitly on a day with the intent of avoiding bad weather. The intent of this lyric seems to be of giving an example of an unfortunate event which is not the definition of irony.Its a free ride when youve already paid You have conceded that this does not seem ironic and I agree.Its the good advice that you just didnt take To quote one of your other posts I agree that this one line is not ironic.I also disagree that the plane crash is ironic since not enough information is given on Mr. Play It Safes expectations of the flight. After all you can still do an action while being afraid that something will go horribly wrong. For example a construction worker may be afraid of falling off a roof but still proceeds to work in such a situation. Since the mans expectations of boarding the plane are never elaborated on we are left to speculate whether or not he expected the plane to crash ergo we cannot conclusively say whether or not it is situational irony. However judging from your responses I do not think you will find this line of reasoning convincing. I do agree however that the mans quip is a perfect example of verbal irony.I also disagree that the song is trying to allude to cosmic irony. From my understanding the concept of cosmic irony is tied to a belief that some type of external force either gods or fate is actively trying to sabotage your plans. I found a good quote here when I was searching for additional definitions of cosmic irony Although cosmic irony can also often be termed as coincidence or bad luck not all coincidences are cosmic irony. It deals only in those coincidences where the action or event is assumed by the person taking the action to have a positive outcome when the actual outcome results in a detrimental consequence to that person. Unlike other forms of irony where someone else is responsible for the twist in circumstance or the misconception of a good result in cosmic irony it is an unknown force such as fate or the universe that seems to be working against the person. A perfect example of this comes from the story of Oedipus where a prophecy is made about the titular character that he will kill his father and marry his mother. In attempt to avoid this his parents order him killed since they cannot bear doing it themselves. The expectation of stopping the prophecy is reversed when Oedipus survives and then proceeds to fulfill the prophecy precisely because his parents attempted to subvert it. The takeaway of the story was supposed to be that no mortal could subvert the will of the Gods. None of these elements are alluded to in the song. There is no mention of the universe Fate any type of malicious God or other interfering agent. This is the crucial element required for a situation to be cosmic irony rather than simply being unfortunate or tragic. I simply do not see enough allusion to this concept in the song to be able to claim the artist intended to invoke this trope.Moreover we both agreed that Morisette included examples of situations which are not ironic at all. Given this plus the fact that she conceded that she did not understand irony that well what is a more reasonable conclusion to reach about the intent of this song The artist was attempting some type of subtle avantgarde approach to talk about instances of irony which most people would not understand. But for whatever reason she later conceded that she did not understand the meaning of irony. The artist confused the meaning of ironic with unfortunate or unexpected and didnt understand that irony denotes much more than that.Using Occams Razor I would have to believe in the latter. I hope to hear your thoughts on this.'},\n",

This makes sense in that the Genie requires that his freedom be wished for in order for him to be free.The problem with this is that the Genie was able to get himself Aladdin and company outside of the Cave of Wonders without it counting as one of Aladdins wishes. In this case it seems the Genie has unlimited power but is constrained to fulfill whatever wishes his master desires which brings us to...Scenario Genie can do what he wants but must follow his masters wishes.lets also assume that the Genie cannot free himselfIn this case the Genie lives his life as he chooses but just wants freedom so he doesnt have to fulfill a random guys wishes.The problem with this then is when Aladdin was handcuffed and drowning why did Genie require Aladdin to wish for himself to be saved? Why wouldnt the Genie just save him using his own relatively free will?In either of these situations why didnt the Genie just strike up a deal with Aladdin that if Aladdin wished for the Genies freedom instantly once the Genie was free the Genie could just provide Aladdin with wishes as if he were the Genies master?This is something that is such a critical part in the plot of the movie that really needs clarifying for me to enjoy the film fully.',\n",

I dont see that as a bad thing but people who like to think of themselves as altruists seem to get offended by the idea and rail against it.Selfserving isnt evil. But Zero one might ask how would a soldier throwing himself on a grenade be selfserving? Truly that is an altruistic action! It is and I dont think its anything less than it is. But that soldier would do so because in so doing they fulfill some moral obligation they hold themselves to. It is in adherence with who they wish to be and through action serves to make it so. It also bears noting that this isnt something I assert necessarily. That is I dont point it out to people as a counter to their claim of being altruistic. The topic only even came about as a result of discussing the view that all actions are selfserving. What about altruistic actions?

At first I was upset. You know the usual Dont use your religion to take away our rights. Plus its important women have access to birth control. Only recently did I learn that Hobby Lobbys policy covers types of birth control ranging from Condoms to the daily pill. The only types of birth control they do not want to pay for are emergency contraceptives the morning after pill and IUDs for some reason. While I dont understand the IUD part maybe one of you can explain it to me better I find the emergency contraceptive part reasonable. My partner and I have needed to use Plan B before. Its a life saver. Its also only about dollars. If you cant afford a dollar pill that will save you from having kids you probably shouldnt be having sex. Plus Planned Parenthood bless their souls provide what they can to those financially lacking. Change my view.Giving it to this person. If I was religious Id probably be able to argue more but utheanswerisfortytwo did a damn good job.

The employees pay for their insurance and should thus be able to make their own decisions about what medications they do or do not want to be on. The employee doesnt go to their manager and say hey can you spot me ? I had sex irresponsibly last night. It just doesnt work like that. Second their issue with Plan B and I.U.Ds are that they believe these cause abortions. They dont. All of the Science behind these medications show that they prevent pregnancy from occuring not ending it after the egg is fertilized. If youre already pregnant these will not help you at all. I.U.D.s are however one of the most effective forms of birth control on the market so if they really do want to decrease the number of abortions not covering the most effective birth controls is really not the way to do so. Third its great that some people have the income to afford for Plan B without filing for insurance. That is unfortunately a luxury not every one has including adults not just teens. Pregnancy and giving birth will cost the Insurance company and the employees who have said policy more money in the long run by not covering these types of medication. Finally this is also about religious freedom vs personal freedom. Hobby Lobby can essentially force their religious beliefs onto their employees by means of limiting what medications they can and can not use. Why should my employer dictate what I can and can not use? Yes there are lots of different kinds of birth control but the reason for that is because different forms of birth control affect people differently. Paying out of pocket for birth control is expensive and not everyone has access to places like Planned Parenthood. The religious views of the company should not out weigh the medical needs of the individual.'},\n",

       "  'counters': 'People who are not professional critics can certainly have valid criticisms about film that are not dependent on their enjoyment. I understand and agree with the sentiment that one should examine art more critically than simply like and dislike. However basing judgement purely on the consensus of professional thought doesnt encourage this it merely appeals to authority. Critics are not always in agreement the opinion on artwork changes over time one could certainly find a current critics darling overrated and consensus may agree with me them in a decade. For example John Updike was widely celebrated as great novelist during his lifetime yet more recent critics have found him to be lacking One reading him during his heyday could have found the same issues as current critics do and yet they would according to your metric be unjustified in their judgement until enough critics shared the same viewpoint.One of the major issues that the modern establishment has with Updike is his narcissistic misogynist viewpoint and yet youll note the linked article only quotes male critics from any generation. I dont believe one needs to be a woman to note this issues in his writing however it does speak to another point critics are not a perfect representation of the populous. The critical establishment has been very white male and upperclass for a long time and celebrated and promoted authors of a similar mindset. Film critics skew Western. While this doesnt invalidate their opinions it means the critical consensus is often based on the perspectives of a smallsubset of the the population. Thus novelists artists like Updike are often hailed as great American novelists when their perspective is as narrow and singularly focused as the authors who get labeled as great AfricanAmerican novelists or women authors and so forth. Examining the perspective of the critics themselves is as important as examining their views.'},\n",

Let me give you an example of a case where its easy to determine whether something is underrated or overrated.At the beginning of each sporting event season various publications rank each team from first to last based on how well they think theyll do. At the end of the year you can look at the final standings and see which teams were overrated and which were underrated. A team that was predicted to come in rd but actually came in th was overrated. In other words overrating is only relevant based on future performance. You argue that whatever ranking is given now is incorrect based on what results will say in the future. Do you agree with this definition at least for sports team rankings?Now things get muddier when you dont have a clear ranking system. Theres no final results for which movies or bands are best instead what we have is a bunch of rating systems that change over time. So in these cases I would take overrated to mean this band is ranked highly in x system now but in years it will be ranked much lower. X can mean popular opinion polls or rolling stones top lists or whatever you choose. Saying the Beatles are overrated means that while they consistently appear at the top of best bands lists in various media in the future they will drop in popularity relative to other bands. You are making a prediction about the future.While Im sure people do use overrated to mean Everyone thinks this is good but I dont thats not a good use for this word.

For instance hearing music makes you sense a color.Synesthesia certainly exists but I believe its importance has been overblown by people who want to be special snowflakes.Everyone experiences synesthesia. Ive never met anyone who upon first learning of the phenomenon didnt claim to have experienced it. I too have experienced it. Its a natural common experience just like all the other shit our brains do on a daily basis.Brains are all about making connections. Synesthesia is just our brains making connections between different sense memories. I would be more surprised if anyone claimed to experience all senses in their pure forms i.e. without association to any other sense.Some people give vivid descriptions of their synesthesic experiences making them sound much more powerful than anything Ive experienced. You might be tempted to say they have true synesthesia like its condition whereas I have only experienced a mild form comparable to the difference between being depressed and sad. I propose two alternate explanations. First these people are probably attention whores. Second if their descriptions are accurate then they probably result from some alternate condition like schizophrenia which enhances all their senses.Some people talk about their synesthesia nonstop even its most mundane forms. For instance I knew a guy who told everyone what color they were to him to me this is as bullshit as being told the color of my aura. Again I think these people are just attention whores. Its like describing your dreams we all have weird dreams that are meaningful and supernatural and fascinating to ourselves but its just your brains white noise and it doesnt make you special.

It is entirely effortless and I cannot suppress it I almost feel that I can perceive the color before I perceive the character since if I glance at a page or a board I can see a mass of color without comprehending the text.I think that a lot of people assume that synesthesia is something everyone experiences because for example we can all imagine colors when listening to music. If you close your eyes and listen to music your imagination will conjure up some visual to accompany it. But the reason this is not true synesthesia is because it is not specific. I cant say for sure because Ive never experienced it but I do believe that there exist people who see colors corresponding to pitches.I do have a theory about the source of my synesthesia unlike many synesthetes apparently. When I was a toddler I had a few sets of colored foam letters that I played with so perhaps corresponding colors were somehow wired into my brain as I was learning the alphabet and how to read.I hope I dont come across as someone who thinks theyre superior to everyone because they have synesthesia I recognize that its a pretty inconsequential phenomenon and that it doesnt make me any better than anyone else though you may meet synesthetes who do not share my view.

Hamas doesnt care about civilian casualties and hides their weaponry in places like churches giving Israel little ability to try to fight them without attacking citizens at the same time. However most Palestinian civilians are barely above the poverty line. There have been at least deaths of innocent Palestinians in response to the deaths of three Israeli teenagers deaths Hamas has denied involvement in and ISIS of Iraq has been screaming bloody murder they are responsible for.. So obviously Israel is responding militarily and punishing civilians for the actions of a few.Also consider Israel has built a wall that the world has not seen the likes of since the Berlin Wall. They have consistently stolen Palestinian land through the settlements burning olive trees as they go. Israel has one of the strongest economies on the planet and one of the largest and most wellrun militaries worldwide. Every single Israeli has a mandatory two years of military service so everyone in the country is very familiar with militarygrade weaponry and uses it exceptionally well. Palestine is a freaking dirthole where all the weapons are homemade or smuggled into the country. None of the Palestinians involved have had any training.None of this means that the crimes of Hamas are forgivable they are not. However the Israeli response is always over the top and the last time I checked punishing a civilian population for the crimes of a handful of people is considered a war crime by the UN.

People protest MRs rallies and whatnot not because they believe men face no disproportionate disadvantages or issues because of their gender or that these things dont deserve a voice but because of the rampant misogyny in the movement the often totally off the mark criticisms of feminism and the virtual uselessness of the movement in actually doing anything do help men.'},\n",

Rather we should congratulate them for hard work not assuming that they are special.

What if there were a set of alleles gene forms that could cause you to enjoy practicing music more maybe because your perception of the music is different? Then you would be genetically predisposed to practice more and you would get better than someone who didnt have those alleles.So how much of the variation in humans is due to genetics? Its different for everything but there are two general ways that we can investigate this. The first is to look directly at biology examine things like aerobic power or differences in bone structure or arm length important for swimmers. The more typical way is to look at heritability to figure out statistically how much of the variation in some trait in this case athleticism is explained by variation in genes. One estimate that I found had a range of . to . where is the maximum for sports participation. Here is another than has an estimate of . heritability for sporting participation.As for whether people should be congratulated for having talent. I dont know. Its not something you control so I dont know why its something to praise. Im much more inclined to praise people for their accomplishments.TLDR genetics and practice go together people with better genes can either practice more or get more out of the same amount of practice.

So the British government has brought out an emergency backdated law to cover their backs. The whole issue of whether we can trust the government to act legally in the first place should be addressed. Bear in mind weve just been informed that there may have been some paedophilia ring being kept under wraps by the government of the s. If they are the kind of people you want to trust with your every phone call email and text message then I feel like your trust is misplaced. We dont live in this rosy world where our politicians and civil servants are virtuous and perfect. Giving them so much power is a huge risk like another poster said its naive to believe the population will regulate the government. The fact both main parties rushed this latest bill in means that whatever programme they have running of data collection is more important than party politics or individual MPs opinions. By this measure the public has zero control over the policy because whoever they vote for are being pressured into keeping this data collection project running at all costs. Which suggests even further that the politicians may have little influence over the decision. Other reasons are that we have to trust every employee who has access or comes into contact with this data. People send passwords sensitive data and all sorts over email. Its not a clever idea but the principle behind email is that its a private message between yourself and someone else. If this database is hacked or leaked then the fallout would be absolutely disastrous. If the whistle blowers like Snowden can leak the details of the operation to the public whos to say other people are leaking the actual data to foreign countries or criminal organisations. The point is this data should not be stored in the first place for such a thing to ever happen. Finally theres just no need for it. Intelligence services should have a good idea of who the potential criminalsterrorists are. Its their job sometimes somebody out of the blue will go out and commit crimes or commit an act of terrorism. But Ive seen zero evidence that mass data suvellience has ever stopped that occurring. It would be far more cheap and efficient and less invasive to target priorities directly given reasonable assumption they were involved in criminal activities or plots. If this system was actually effective at doing what it claims to be doing then surely organised crime would be dropping to minuscule levels? Finally where does it end?

Some things I noticed Hyperbole and misrepresentation. Obviously its a circlejerk sub but I really feel like people there actually believe what they say about what feminists believe. I lurk rfemradebates a lot and have learned a lot about both MRM and feminism there and have noticed a huge disconnect between whats said there and what people circlejerk about in TiA. What TiA says about feminists is like what SRS says about MRAs. Outrage culture. Its been getting really bad there lately.. it used to be pretty chill but people are getting so angry and worked up that it feels really toxic now. I browse rtiadiscussion and a lot of people seem to agree. There was even a sticky mod post about how to deal with rage... Missing sarcasmobvious jokes and circlejerking about the opposition anyways. SRS does this a lot with regards to MRAs and they get a lot of flak rightfully for it. But then I see things like this on the front page of TiA and am starting to think that you can post almost anything fake from Tumblr to circlejerk about. Starting to attract actual bigots. SRS can get really bad with the actual communists eg. MaoStalin apologists and that sucks. Im a Muslim and I really hate how Tumblr tries to speak on our behalf but I hate Islamophobes way more. Threads like this were really disheartening to me especially because the article itself was so sensationalist and pretty much made shit up. I had the OP of that thread tagged as an Islamophobic white nationalist before so it sucks to see that actual bigots can get away with using the sub as a political soapbox.

I remember seeing someone try to support Affirmative Action on the sub and they got hammered with downvotes even when they were being completely reasonable. this part made the thread go in a direction i didnt care about so Im removing ittldr Im starting to dislike TiA because its become like a mirror of rshitredditsays.

Ill give you a couple of reasons the Palestinians have it this bad that are much worse in my opinion than the Israeli government. Hamas Hamas is a terrorist organisation known by most of the western world as such. It holds full control of the Gaza strip and it got its power by force when Israel left the Gaza strip and surrounding areas a political party called the Fatah was democratically chosen to be in charge. they were driven out by force having most of its high ranking members killed and their bodies dragged through the streets.The Hamas organization only wants the complete destruction of the state of Israel to establish an Islamic State just like the one currently forming in Iraq and Syria ISIS this organization doesnt care about the Palestinian people and it actually uses them as human shield and as propaganda machine there are accounts of Hamas invading a civilian house for launching rockets from it killing the resident family in the process and then blaming the IDF for doing it. The point you have to realize is that Hamas is at war with Israel and the Palestinians are kept hostages in the middle of it all. Other mideast countries and the U.N after Israels independents war there were a lot of Palestinian refugees fleeing to countries like Jordan Lebanon Syria and Egypt thinking the small newborn state o Israel has no chance to survive this war raged against enemy states. and believing that soon they will return to their abandoned homes.these refugees are in that status for well over years and noone is trying to change that. they have their own special status in the U.N. unlike any refugee in any other part in the world controlled by the corrupt UNRWA controlled by the states they are currently in.They have practically no rights for labor travel and free speech.They are trapped in the status of refugee and cant change it furthermore them and all descendants of them are defined as refugees as well. This is also to make them seem like the victims which they are and then blame it on Israel otherwise how could they paint it as an evil state that must be eliminated? Corrupt leaders Even though the state of things in the west bank is far better than whats happening in Gaza things could be much better. The west bank gets millions of dollars in donations and foreign aid to help their institutions and education these funds never reach their destination and remains in the hands of bureaucrats and politicians. When children have an almost wrecked school The principle of said school lives in a palace of a house with money received in education aid. Currently the situation for the Palestinians is awful and there are a lot of different reasons for it. but the main reason is because for a lot of powerful people usually in the arab world there are agendas to be obtained and for that to happen the Palestinians need to look like victims. So theyll stay in the victim status no matter what Israel does to try and change it.'},\n",

Just in very recent years people have finally begun getting past homophobia or the notion that gay lesbian and transgender people should be denied rights and considerations which heterosexual people take for granted.

However if I came to work wearing a dashiki and a kufi they would assume I had lost my mind. If I came to work wearing a cape underwear and cowboy boots I might face termination. The consequences of stepping outside accepted dress codes can be severe and nobody thinks twice about the prejudices and odd assumptions that underlie our attitudes about clothing.

This is also a big issue in eastern Asia where disposable chopsticks are consumed at an alarming rate.I think we should return to the system of medieval Europe where people brought a knife for eating wherever they went and while eating out there would be no expectation for the host to provide cutlery. This could be done easily with either a hybrid of a forkknifespoon or simply bringing several tools for the job. A nondisposable pair of chopsticks would be even easier to bring with you too.This would also be a boon for hygiene as every person would be responsible for keeping their set of cutlery clean preferably with some type of paper napkin to rub over with after a meal.A common counterargument I get is about where one would carry the cutlery especially for men who tend to not bring handbags with them.

       "  'arguments': 'Note Let me preface by saying that I realize this viewpoint has been discussed on this subreddit before but I dont feel like it expanded the discussion enough. In any case those threads are dead and difficult to revive. There are new points that I would like to bring up.For the most part this concept is only discussed in politics but I would like to shift the discussion away from politics as much as possible. I think this problem exists in social media on a complicated level that we havent fully defined yet. I really hope someone here is able to put what I am attempting to describe in better words than I can or help me understand if Im missing something. The definition of satire is the use of humor irony exaggeration or ridicule to expose and criticize peoples stupidity or vices particularly in the context of contemporary politics and other topical issues.TV shows such as SNL The Colbert Report and South Park use excessive satire usually to prove a point that is part of the creators belief system. Let me point out that satire is a beautiful thing that helps us understand others beliefs in an entertaining way but I think it has gotten to a point where it is more damaging than progressive.TV shows like South Park and The Daily Show have been on air for nearly years. Children of the late s and early s have been subjected to heavy amounts of satire from childhood and into adulthood. As a result I believe that satire has become so heavily ingrained into the brains of emerging adults that it is having very negative sideeffects.These sideeffects are making it cool to hate. I see so many examples of this throughout social media. For some reason and I dont know why it is considered cool to hate the actor Nicolas Cage. Through social media and online memes these strange ideas have spread. Suddenly many people of the younger generation decide to bash Nicolas Cage and claim he is a terrible actor with complete ignorance or reasoning. We see the same thing happen with many other celebrities as well.But okay Nic Cage is just a celebrity and it shouldnt matter right? But I cant help but see this blind hate emerging everywhere. It extends itself to stereotypes as well and this is where I draw the line. I believe it has gotten to the point where it becomes cool to hate women. It becomes cool to hate hipsters. It even becomes cool to hate different websites such as Facebook Reddit or Twitter. The reason I believe this is a problem is because it promotes a lot of ignorant and aimless negative thought. And I understand that it has always been cool to hate in one form or another but nowadays we are subjected to it in our Facebook feeds on our mobile phones in our music everywhere. This hate surrounds us so much that it becomes such a normal part of our day and is accepted as okay.The worst part about it all is that it doesnt promote healthy and thoughtful discussion. If someone is accused of satirical slander its easy for the accuser to avoid defending themselves by ridiculing or saying its only a joke calm down. There is truth in all jokes and I dont think it should be taken lightly in the world we live in today.Satire is manipulating truthful original and thoughtful discussion. The reason I posted here in the first place is because I know this subreddit doesnt tolerate the cool to hate mentality. It is all about progression and original thought.Im afraid I may be discussing two separate issues and I encourage others to help organize my thoughts. Im very interested in getting down to the core of this issue. I sure as hell hope someone can change my view because its leading me down a rabbit hole and Im seeing a dark and passiveaggressive future ahead of us.',\n",
       "  'counters': 'I think theres one key flaw in the way you notice satires harms today just because satire rose and so did cool to hate doesnt mean satire caused cool to hate. In fact such a cool to hate mentality has existed for a long time a really really long time. The counterculture movements of the past the s in particular come to mind stand as evidence to this not only was it cool to hate but entire subcultures developed to be different from what was popular or standard. Im not convinced that cool to hate is even on the rise. Perhaps it is more noticeable but that doesnt mean it has become more prevalent. In fact the rise of the internet and internet memes are responsible for a lot of what youre noticing Nicholas Cage hating isnt part of a society of haters its just a nonserious internet joke.Harmful examples of hate in society do exist. But this is driven by establishment norms. Prejudices like homophobia racism sexism etc are almost entirely driven by a desire to conserve social ways of the past a desire to either keep things the way they are or take things back to the past. But satire is inherently antiestablishment. Satire itself addresses these issues. Notice how absent conservative satire is popular satire is either libertarian or liberal and both perspectives have definite goals of lessening social hate and discrimination.Perhaps the greatest advantage of satire is its ability to awaken people who are hateful to their past mindsets. It can get someone to laugh before realizing that they laugh at themselves. It makes political issues easier to discuss and more enjoyable to access. The type of person who wouldnt want to listen to NPR reports for hours may learn something from satire. In fact there have been studies done that find satirical news shows like The Daily Show and Colbert Report to be more informative than many traditional news shows. It isnt some new antidiscourse device but something that has been around for literally thousands of years. Satire doesnt have to be ignorant or aimless in fact I find that it is some of the most enlightened and focused efforts. Modern media becomes focused with arbitrary things. Sensationalism runs rampant. Remember when CNN wouldnt stop talking about the Malaysian plane for an entire month? Satire is an alternative to that. It brings more people to the discussion table. It isnt supposed to replace traditional discussion but supplement it and thats exactly the role it plays today.'},\n",

Doctor Who is about someone breaking out of the confinement of their society and going on a grand adventure by stealing what is essentially a magic box. The Doctor is also generally played by very charismatic actors and it is intriguing to wonder what it would be like to essentially be a god in that he is near immortal and Time Lords are essentially all knowing thanks to their research.In terms of the special effects they have improved in the era but Ive never cared much about them.

The show is simply about going on adventures with an interesting character. No more no less. Do I think it is one of the greatest shows ever? Absolutely.

This wondrous piece of heaven is made using your typical cake ingredients such as eggs flour and sugar. Heres the twist that really adds to the cake......drum roll please.....buttermilk! But iheartaegislash the name is cocacola cake why is it the buttermilk thats the real MVP? Dont fret though the cocacola adds flavor to the cake without overpowering it but the buttermilk really brings out the flavor of the other ingredients. It still tastes like a delicious chocolate cake and is incredibly rich so you only need to have a small piece to really get the enjoyment out of it. Now I know youre thinking to yourself here wait a minute iheataegislash wont this cake dry out before I can enjoy it? Now heres where the coke really shines. It does an amazing job of keeping the cake from drying out and preserving the flavor. I once had one that stayed fresh for about . weeks at which point I ate the entire thing so it may have lasted longer. Best eaten with a chilled glass of milk. Ice Cream Cake. I feel like ice cream cake is a trump card of sorts in these debates. Quite frankly I didnt want to even include it here because bringing up ice cream cake is almost not fair to pie. It solves all of the issues of being oversweet you can have as much as you want without getting terribly ill and I dont know anyone trying to force a carrot ice cream cake on you. Theres likely nothing I can say here that you already know but delicious amazing and most people who arent lactose intolerant love the stuff more than apple pie. Spice Cake Ah Spice cake. If youve never had it before I want you to imagine a carrot cake. But wait you exclaim! I hate carrot cake!! Patience young one. Imagine a carrot cake but without all of that terrible B.S. that no one likes in a carrot cake. Chunks of carrot? Gone. Kind of vague fruity taste? Gone and Gone! Cream cheese icing? You better believe its gone! Spice cake when done properly uses butter cream icing. I know I know the sweets thing but because of the mixture of spices included in the cake it doesnt get overly sweet. Ive downed about of a full spice cake after eating a meal and though I was full I was the happiest guy in the room mostly because everyone else only got to split s of this delightful concoction.I will close now with one final thought. Baseball is fun but the season seems to drag on forever. Because of that a lot of people only watch it for the world series or fantasy baseball. Pie is the same way and overconsumption can lead to problems Cake is a lot more like American football.

If youve promised your family three weeks in Waikiki and you come down with the flu by god youre not going to make your kids cry by telling them you have to leave three days early. Paid vacation days are a benefit. Paid sick leave is more like insurance its there if you need it gone if you dont. If people could cash in their unspent health insurance premiums at the end of each year theyd do that too. Then youd have employees refusing to get kidney dialysis so they can afford a down payment on a car next year. Obviously having your employees show up to work sick and infecting everyone else is not ideal. Therefore you take away the incentive for them to sacrifice paid sick leave for more vacation time. Obviously some employees lie about being sick and use their sick days as vacation days but thats a lesser problem than greedy employees spreading swine flu in the office rather than burn their vacation days.'},\n",

This is the main time off. The fact that its planned gives you some time to organize a nice time off far away from the office which is necessary for your mental health and work efficiency.Then sick days as illustrated by downroads is to send the message that the company understands that everyone gets sick once in a while and that you dont have to worry about that. Youre sick too tired to work well and potentially contagious stay at home without having to take on your planned vacation time nor to be less paid. Of course dont be dishonest and use sick days if youre not sick. The company is not telling you to be out for a certain amount of days every year where you could be sick its just telling you that they understand if youre sick and respect it.Personal days. Still not touching on your planned vacation the company understands that shit happens.. and repairmen dont particularly enjoy working at night nor do delivery companies. We hope you dont order sofas and washing machine every year that require you to stay at home to wait for the delivery guy but once in a while you need some time like everyone to wait for some guy or arrange some personal issue... and the company can understand that. Again its not about you should take that may days off that are due to you its really without touching your vacation we understand you have some personal duties that can require that you take half a day or a day of sometimes so we make it easy for you to show you that we like you and hope you are happy to work with us.If you transform all that into a common pool then people will simply try to take more vacations then when theyre sick they will be unhappy as theyll think theyre taking on their vacation time which is not the intent and same for their personal issues to fix during the day.

       "  'arguments': 'Whenever I play a game like Wastelands or Xenonauts these are the two that spring to mind though Ive played others and finally get to the combat I feel like the game grinds to a halt. This happens with any sort of turn based combat in RPG games. I should point out that GrandStrategy games like Civ or Total War are not what Im talking about here. The games themselves arent whats boring. I thought that the two I mentioned above had cool premises and were super detailed in lore two things I love about games. But when the combat started the nice flow that I had been experiencing stops. Ill try and list the things that bother me.. Action Points I get the reasoning behind them but they limit what I want to do so badly I want to throw my computer out the window. They simply seem unrealistic.. Enemies Perhaps its because I never played long enough to get better equipment but every time I play and try to attack I always miss at point blank range. However at yards the enemy seems to be a dead eye with every shot.. Turns Things will happen to my guys on an enemy turn that I cant react to like I would in Age of Empires Company of Heroes etc... and it seems unrealistic. One time I was playing Xenonats and the aliens made one of my soldiers go nuts and started shooting everyone. IRL and in RTS games youd move your guys away and try to kill the crazed soldier but nope I had to sit there and watch three of my guys get slaughtered because it was the Enemy Turn.I know Ill probably get responses like Oh well you just havent played them enough or You sound like you dont know what youre doing. Which are both true but the games make me so mad that I dont want to even try and get better. In an RTS if I accidentally lose my tank to an enemy emplacement thats my fault and I should have been paying attention more to the situation. But it could have happened in a split second far to fast for me to react and that doesnt bother me because shit happens like that IRW all the time. In a turn based game if I miss it I have to sit there and watch helplessly as the enemy takes it out and I watch the camera hover over the wreckage as if to say Look dumbass ya coulda stopped it but you got too frustrated.I do really want to have my view changed on this.',\n",
       "  'counters': 'Ill deal with number because I think it may be the most pertinent also what I say may apply to number as well.Part of the fun in turnbased strategy and Im sure other turnbased combat systems games is prediction and manipulation of the RNG which determines the actions of your opponent. The example that first comes to mind for me is XCOM Enemy Unknown and Enemy Within. XCOM is a turnbased combat game that makes you rely on prediction of how the computer is going to work to win. The fact that you cannot do anything once the enemy has attacked is precisely the point. What you are intended to do is maneuver it so that the enemy cant attack or cant attack in any meaningful way. In XCOM especially on the harder difficulties if the enemy has a chance to get a shot off at all it almost always spells demise for your soldiers especially in the early game. What a skilled player will do is make it so their soldiers are always just out of the line of sight or sitting in sight but with a high enough defense rating to make an enemy shot exceedingly unlikely.As far as Im concerned this isnt a skill that can be taught especially well. Its a skill that you will have to learn through trial and error and through playing a game enough where you can get a hold of the system and manipulate it so that you dont lose. To me thats what the fun is in these games. The background story elements and characters are so much set dressing the real fun of the game is taking apart a system and figuring out how to exploit it so that you will be able to beat it at its own game.'},\n",

       "  'counters': 'People who fail to capitalize and punctuate their writing properly are just lazy. Welcome to meritocracy! Youve bought it hook line and sinker. And heres where it gets tricky...youre not wrong. Meritocracy works sort of. What I mean when I use the term meritocracy is that youre describing a system where people who work hard do better. People who dont work hard do poorly. In other words you get what you merit in the system. Quick history lesson this is the bedrock idea of our country. America as it was becoming a nation had a lot of problems. Nations were based on very specific sets of criteria. They shared a religion. They shared a language. They shared a kingqueen an ethnicity a stable geographical boundary a history. America had none of that. It was a hodge podge of languages religions ethnicity cultures and very flexible geographical boundaries. There was no way really to call it a nation in the way Europe would conceive of such a thing. Instead America formed around a national ideology taken pretty much directly from the Puritans if you strip the God parts out and recycled into a kind of manifest destiny. The idea was simple This is the place where you can be anything you want to be. Unlike classiest Europe with a dearth of social mobility this will be built on the meritocracy of ideas and people. But there are problemsThere are problems with meritocracy. A lot of them. That doesnt dismiss the successes however. You yourself point out that youve taken advantage of the system and you have bettered yourself. Thats great. There are a lot of success stories but there are also a lot of failures. When you just look at one side of the spectrum you dont get the whole story. Heres an obvious fault meritocracy says that if youre not succeeding then it must be your fault. Theres no bad luck involved. Theres no shitty parenting medical issues or other impairments taken into the equation. If youre not succeeding it is your own fault. Thats fine to a certain extent until you realize that it cant really be true. Just like there are stories like yours people who work hard and get ahead there are also stories of people who work their asses off and never get anywhere. One mistake can sink you. So if were talking about Merit with the capital M were fucking it up. That person working hours a week to make sure the rent gets paid and her kids get a decent education has a fuck ton of merit but that doesnt equate to dollars. You say go to college but the kids she had with the guy who said hed love her forever and bailed five years ago say otherwise. No one is there to put dinner on the table so shes pretty stuck. Are we still talking about merit? Meritocracy ignores prejudice. All kinds. We dont need to debate the here and now of it but Black people have been pretty screwed by meritocracy. Gentrification is a huge aspect of this that often gets overlooked. In the midst of second wave feminism this was a problem for women. And Asian Americans. And Italians. And the Irish. And just about everyone. Meritocracy assumes a level playing field. It assumes youll be judged based on the skills you bring to the table alone. We all know thats not the way things work. Meritocracy ignores the real failures in capitalism. There are failures. How you handle those is a pretty hot button DemRep issue but thats not the question. For people who got screwed in the housing market collapse or for those who lost their retirement YEARS of merit were washed away. Retirement accounts lost their value by a half or two thirds. Houses went under water. People who worked hard and didnt play fast and loose with their money were taken down by the swinging shifts of capitalism. Their success isnt about their merit. Sometimes it is just dumb luck. Which leads me to the fourth problem some people start the game with more poker chips on the table. Good for them. We dont have to be snotty about it. But staring life with parents that make kyear makes you a pretty good bet in terms of success. Were NOT all being judged on merit. Were being judged by who our friends are who our parents friends are what kind of education we can afford what kind of social signals we can present at large to the world. These things matter and they matter a lot. Everyone fighting their way up has to fight against the people who were already there. And were not talking about the super rich here. Were talking about the solid upper middle class. Its a complicated puzzle. Hard work and personal merit are pieces of it. Health is a piece. Race is a piece. Gender is a piece. Socioeconomic background natural talents social values and local resources come into play. Its not just one thing. But we live in a narrative that says it is about merit and weve been living that narrative since the s. And its not wrong. Youre not wrong. It is just more complicated.'},\n",

NB I pretty much just talking about civil rights here. Political and economic inequality are somewhat different issuesHeres a basic outline of my position and the opposing oneMy belief Equality for any oppressed group can only logically happen if the enough of the oppressors realize their fault and change Ignorance breeds intolerance and therefore education breeds tolerance In the case of the Feminist movement activists should work to make society aware of problems and favor hard data to rhetoric not that rhetoric isnt useful Youre better served by telling someone why theyre wrong than by berating them Criticize the action rather than the person. For example tell someone that what they did was racist not that theyre racist and they should feel ashamed even if they are Equality not only means being able to achieve the same result as another person but being able to achieve it with the same easedifficultyOpposing belief Equality for any oppressed group can only be achieved by empowerment of the oppressed group enabling them to go their own way Gains need to be won without any connection with the oppressor because theyre not going to help. If they were they wouldnt be oppressors Feminist activists should take whats rightfully theirs instead of waiting for it to be handed over to them Youre better off berating someone who practices intolerance to express the seriousness of what theyve done Criticizing an intolerant persons character might make them reconsider their positions Activists have been trying to educate for a long time and the hate is still flowingTLDR What serves modern movements like the fights for womens and minority rights better the approach of MLK or that of Malcolm X?',\n",

Despite their attempts to educate the public as well as research published by Kinsey and others very little changed until .On June police raided the Stonewall Inn a gaytrans bar in New York. Although this had been a common practice for several years this time the LGBT community had had enough. Violent riots broke out and continued for the better part of three days. This event as well as the White Night Riots might be the two most defining and important events for the promotion of LGBT rights in the USA.Maybe a constant stream of education might have been able to have the same effect over s and s of years but it seems unquestionable that these actions greatly accelerated the march toward equality.I dont want to make it sound like education is not important it is but some of the biggest leaps in civil rights have been made when the minority group demanded equality and took it by force.

Overall the standard of living is significantly lower and most people live month to month paycheck to paycheck.Aside from finances changing to a new country involves a lot of personal sacrifice. Leaving friends and family behind is tough and forging new friendships and relationships can be challenging especially if theres a language barrier. Culture shock is real and youll learn to appreciate some things about American culture that you had taken for granted before. Overall this can be a positive experience.After Ive reflected on my comments depending on where you are in your career I would recommend that you do leave the country for a short time. Maybe do a stint in Asia or Latin America teaching English for a year. Itll give you new insights into what is really good and bad about America. Its valuable work and life experience BUT dont burn any bridges back to the US. File your taxes you probably wont have to pay anything as taxes are until like K keep your passport up to date and maintain your citizenship you never know when you might want to or need to go back.'},\n",

Besides if you bail then you are making your position weaker. You are removing your weight from behind your views and making that apathy and opposing views that much stronger by comparison.You know what you could do instead? Work with an existing organization or start a new one. The PACs cut in all directions and your feelings are surprisingly common. The only thing you have to do is give people an easy way to express those feelings. A little bit of organization a clear direction and pressure on a couple of issues at a time and you will see results. It happens all the time on state and local levels. Its just much harder to see nationally because America is kind of huge and it take a lot of pressure to budge and it takes a lot of organization to get that pressure all pointed in the right direction at the right targets to make change happen.'},\n",

However I would suggest that you consider how hurt you would feel if you went to a wedding and people felt it unpleasant to see you dance with your fiance it would feel awful. The easiest thing to do honestly is simply not to pay attention to them since I very much doubt you pay large attention to the dancing or kisses of straight couples around you at weddings.The simplest solution I can see to this is to speak to this person but not make it in any way related to her orientation. Simply make it clear that you are hoping for a calm and tasteful wedding and that nobody regardless of gender or orientation will be welcome if they cannot respect the other guests. Something that might be worth thinking about is why are you getting married? Most people get married because they want to have their relationship recognised by their loved ones. Now imagine if you were invited to a wedding but your fiance was not imagine how disrespectful that would be. That is what you are doing to these people you are telling them that because of something out of their control their gender of their partner their relationship is not real to you. You are saying that they do not count as a real couple that you do not respect them or their partner.'},\n",

Hooray for possibility!Now these bodies and lives of ours happen to be on this little blue ball. At this point in history the number of human actions that happen off this blue ball are statistically negligible and the farthest any of us has gone from the ball is a negligible distance on any grand scale.This place is our home we as a species and each of us as an individual arose here and we were able to arise and thrive BECAUSE of little details that on a cosmic scale are totally arbitrary. The force of gravity here the details of climate particular mineral composition the speed at which it spins. All these things change over time but the way they are now is part of the greater rhythm of the place. If things were not as they are we would be different if we even arose as a species at all if life even arose at all.If life is precious then so MUST be the place that allows life and the conditions arbitrary as they are that allowed it to be.We find it useful as beings who plan and create to measure time and our home just so happens to facilitate that process. Light and dark cycle as do seasons. The units arent particularly exact by modern scientific standards but they were more than enough to usher in the rise of human civilization.And we cant say that these units of time are not meaningful to life on this planet. The destinies of species are carved into the rising and setting of the sun. Animals do their hunting their hiding their sleeping in accordance with these cycles and we for far longer than we had wristwatches lived by these cycles as well.Likewise the seasons. We watch in much of the world life bloom fourish wither and hide only to emerge again all on these schedules.Now these days we have wonderful technology that places us in some ways above these cycles. We stay up all night with our electric lights. We can be warm in the winter and cool in the summer and eat whatever we please. And we could if we wished invent any new unit of telling time that we wished. But on the scale of our species this is all terribly new. As biological beings we still respond to the rhythms of our home rock. The same way that ones childhood home evokes a sense of nostalgia. The arbitrary details take on a meaning because you as a person were forged there. That hill was a random effect of a passing glacier but for you sledding down it by yourself was the moment you first embraced your own bravery. That doorframe was just a chunk of wood but it held the history of your growth each gain in height corresponding to new secrets of the world unlocking for you. Your fears are engraved there too failures as well. The cycles of our home world may one day have no relevance to us. But today each day we can greet the morning having seen the light change and change back again. Each year we can greet the anniversary of our birth having once more seen the seasons change and change back again. This place whose happenstance turns have been etched into our minds and into our very DNA has shown us yet another go round and begins again. To celebrate the cycle weve just been through and rejoice in the opportunity hopefully to see another is the joy of life on earth. It will be sad when this joy is gone.'},\n",

Many straight people view you as gay and many gay people view you as a slutty liar.Also depending on how strong the antigay feelings are where you live you may say to yourself well I dont want people to know I like dudes so Im just going to date girls.

If they were for example using this to profile an average person like you or me and then trying to entice us to commit crimes that we wouldnt normally commit I would have a much bigger problem with it. That would be entrapment. But here were talking about people who are KNOWN to be committing serious and sometimes violent crimes on a regular basis and theyre using the information to help catch them in the act.I tend to agree with this sentiment and I am fully aware that this is the start of a very slippery slope which could EASILY turn towards using it against people who havent actually committed a crime yet in a sort of Minority Report precognitive way. And even more conspiratorial I can imagine this becoming a tool in societal engineering in the sense that it could be used to stop political movements before they start. But I am not convinced that this is actually happening... YET.So back to the original post concerning why people dont already massively protest this... its because this is a very grey area that many people wouldnt have a problem with even if they knew for a fact that it was happening. As I said in another comment this system still requires them to find traditionally admissible evidence with a warrant they still have to do the grunt work after this guides them to the honey jar.I see some possible futures when it comes to the whole topic of secret surveillance in general.. they get greedy use this on lesser and lesser crimes and it eventually becomes so widely known that people become scared that its not just drug dealers and gun runners anymore. This sparks more widespread outcries and activism and the public finally denounces it forcing its power to be restricted or revoked.. Law enforcement attempts to make this sort of evidence admissible in court publicly a national debate ensues and again the power of warrantless information is legally neutered due to public pressure.Either of these paths could end in two ways peacefully or violently as in notso peaceful protests BUT I simply do not believe that the citizens of the United States or any other country will somehow continue to allow this to progress out of complacency or some crap like that. Take the civil rights movement for example. The things that instigated the massive protests to end racial segregation were not small events they were events that affected thousands of black people. People could SEE everyday that there were two bathrooms for blacks and whites that they werent allowed to get an education that they were physically beaten and killed by police and even civilians and that they were loudly and unsympathetically abused verbally all occurring over the course of years and years.

I think basketball also loses many talented players due to the lack of heightclasses.Only reason I couldnt see this happening is funding but for community and school sports it should be a nobrainer.

You dont have to be the guy taking most of the shots you can just be the guy moving the ball.Old school Nintendos Ice Hockey game demonstrated this reasonably well you could have played all big guys against one another but youd miss out on numerous opportunities against teams that utilized the midsized and skinny guys.At the same time the risks to personal injury are far greater with mismatched sizes in boxing where injury is kind of the whole point whereas those risks are substantially reduced in what should be a nearnocontact sport.Sidenote might be worth reading up on Muggsy Bogues as an example of an exceptional short player.'},\n",

This basically means that if you and your family own a company that gets large enough that you can sell some of it to raise capital you can still run it according to your values. This doesnt mean a company the size of apple could do the same thing.It is also almost completely being neglected that it only applies to types of birth control. They didnt limit coverage for all preventative birth control measures only a few retroactive ones that they consider to be similar to abortion.People are also under no obligation to work for these companies. Likely the people who work for these companies work there because they share the values of the company and thus arent affected by the decision.Some people make the argument that its a slippery slope which is a logical fallacy. It doesnt open some Pandoras box. If it did though if the world worked that way I would rather have the box opened that could lead to more individual freedom from governmental power than the box that would be opened with an opposite ruling opening the door for the government to impose laws on anyone regardless of their ideological stances.

They were invented in the US.. Marketing.In fact its much more than in my opinion.

More strategy is involved in soccer and MMA more execution is involved in basketball and hockey.And Ive never had someone give me a decent reason that MLB is entertaining at all.I just dont see how these sports are anything but selffulfilling marketing agencies.

Because of the nature of the game every players effectiveness can be broken down into a series of stats ERA RBIs hits on base percentage batting average etc.. This means that anyone who has fun studying or playing around with numbers has a great deal of things they can analyse about baseball.Personally I find American Football to be the funnest sport in the world to watch. Every millisecond that the ball is in play has something important happening and could potentially only be a few seconds from either team scoring. Few other sports have the same concentration of excitement. Meanwhile in between the snaps there is a great deal of strategy and mind games involved as each team tries to guess what the other is going to do and adjust accordingly.As someone who has played all three I find this idea laughable. There is very little metagame strategy involved in MMA. It mostly consists of something along the lines of Hes better standing and Im better on the ground. So I want to get him on the ground. Soccer has a bit more strategy but it is still rather simplistic and mostly relies on execution. Meanwhile a football team will completely change the way they play against different teams. If your opponent has a star wide receiver then you double cover him. If their quarterback tends to hold the ball you pass rush. At the same time if you see double coverage you run plays that pass to a different guy or run it. If you see a pass rush coming you use short passes or draw plays. The strategy is different after every play and needs to be constantly adjusted rather than being mostly or completely decided before you ever set foot on the field.What I find most enjoyable about the NFL however is the sheer athletic prowess demonstrated. Most sports have a narrow range of body types that tend to do well at the sport but football has a broad range. You have hulking behemoths of men who are stronger than just about any other man on the planet and would likely be at home in no other sport besides sumo wrestling. At the same time you have men who are as fast as Olympic sprinters and men who can jump clear over another mans head. These men are all out on the field and for a brief few seconds they are all showing exactly how far the human body can be pushed in each different way. there is no other sport where you will see such feats of strength speed and agility demonstrated at the same time.As far as being a good game for entertainment the start and stop nature of football is excellent for TV. In between each play there is enough time to show a slow motion replay and have the announcers analyze it without the viewer missing any gameplay. Constantly moving sports lack this and if you miss a crucial detail in a play then you will not get a chance to see it again.'},\n",

I feel about it pretty strongly and all of these are basically going against most relationship advice I hear that is considered mature while my mentality is often regarded as shallow or immature. I wand to understand better where the other side is coming from.Title explains it summed up here are my arguments and additional views that may be relevant. Relationship is not superior to being single and should not be searched for at all cost. Relationship should be wanted only when there is a person you want to be in a relationship with.. You either want someone or you dont. You are either attracted to them or you arent. They can be nice and compatible but if they arent what you want there is no point in trying to make it work for the sake of being nice or fair. Relationships arent deserved.. Preferring physically attractive people does not make you shallow. In fact it is shallow to assume that relationships are so important that persons preferences in them determine their whole depth as human beings.. There is no objective measure as to what should or shouldnt be changed for the sake of your partner. You have to take the person for what they are and not imagine you will change them or compromise and change yourself for them unless it is a change you want to make yourself. For example it is considered unreasonable to expect your SO to stop talking to someone you dont like but it is reasonable to expect your SO to stop drinking every day. In my opinion no one owes their partner a change and no one owes a relationship you can leave over anything you dont like and you dont have to change anything you dont want to. BUT there should be no hard feelings because neither side is a bitch or a jerk for their choice. Its not a moral issue either.. No one owes a relationship. It is ok to only want sex with someone hot over wanting a relationship and looking for deeper things that isnt in any way a moral issue.. Standards arent objective even though many people might share the same standards. You dont have to give back everything you expect you simply have to know what you want and someone either fits or doesnt.. It is stupid that people get offended for not being someones type. You arent hurting anyone by not wanting to be with them over something even if they think the reason isnt fair. Relationships arent favors or rewards anyway. . There is no bad reason to end a relationship. I keep hearing people say how someone broke up with them over something dumb think of it the dumber the reason someone breaks up with you over the more it means that the relationship wasnt that important to them in the first place. Which means the break up was necessary even more so than when people in love break up over something big and understandable. . Being with someone or staying with someone you dont want the most is harming not only you but them as well. Someone might like them more than you do so committing yourself while not that attracted or for the sake of keeping the relationship effort was put in is in fact disrespectful to the other person. Therefore they should not get angry but understand the situation.However problem still is that these type of relationships may not be something many people can handle at least not at this point. But a lot about them makes so much sense to me that now I would change the focus of this view all together because it is only a little part of a much bigger problem underneath.',\n",

I wand to understand better where the other side is coming from.Title explains it summed up here are my arguments and additional views that may be relevant. Relationship is not superior to being single and should not be searched for at all cost. Relationship should be wanted only when there is a person you want to be in a relationship with.. You either want someone or you dont. You are either attracted to them or you arent. They can be nice and compatible but if they arent what you want there is no point in trying to make it work for the sake of being nice or fair. Relationships arent deserved.. Preferring physically attractive people does not make you shallow. In fact it is shallow to assume that relationships are so important that persons preferences in them determine their whole depth as human beings.. There is no objective measure as to what should or shouldnt be changed for the sake of your partner. You have to take the person for what they are and not imagine you will change them or compromise and change yourself for them unless it is a change you want to make yourself. For example it is considered unreasonable to expect your SO to stop talking to someone you dont like but it is reasonable to expect your SO to stop drinking every day. In my opinion no one owes their partner a change and no one owes a relationship you can leave over anything you dont like and you dont have to change anything you dont want to. BUT there should be no hard feelings because neither side is a bitch or a jerk for their choice. Its not a moral issue either.. No one owes a relationship. It is ok to only want sex with someone hot over wanting a relationship and looking for deeper things that isnt in any way a moral issue.. Standards arent objective even though many people might share the same standards. You dont have to give back everything you expect you simply have to know what you want and someone either fits or doesnt.. It is stupid that people get offended for not being someones type. You arent hurting anyone by not wanting to be with them over something even if they think the reason isnt fair. Relationships arent favors or rewards anyway. . There is no bad reason to end a relationship. I keep hearing people say how someone broke up with them over something dumb think of it the dumber the reason someone breaks up with you over the more it means that the relationship wasnt that important to them in the first place. Which means the break up was necessary even more so than when people in love break up over something big and understandable. . Being with someone or staying with someone you dont want the most is harming not only you but them as well. Someone might like them more than you do so committing yourself while not that attracted or for the sake of keeping the relationship effort was put in is in fact disrespectful to the other person. Therefore they should not get angry but understand the situation.However problem still is that these type of relationships may not be something many people can handle at least not at this point. But a lot about them makes so much sense to me that now I would change the focus of this view all together because it is only a little part of a much bigger problem underneath.',\n",
       "  'counters': 'The interesting thing for me is that I think I agree with all of your points and cant find a massively great specific rebuttal to almost any of them however I have a general rebuttal.One thing Id like to point out is that many if not most of the points you present seem to possibly imply that all relationships are or must be by definition monogamous.I think most of the points you gave are actually excellent general reasons for a given person to perhaps consider polyamory instead. Its still quite socially taboo and though Ill probably take heat for this I tend to notice most people are far more accepting of gayslesbianswhatever than they are of polyamorous people.I dont know if any of the following directly addresses explicitly any of your numbered points but I think it at least implicitly addresses some of them.. Level of desirelevel of willingness to changeno one owes anyone anything.Yeah I pretty much agree on this aspect and I think its kind of a perfect rationale for polyamory.Before I go further Id like to clarify that while very obvious in its slant this post is in no way trying to say that polyamory is the only or the best arrangement for humans and that much of the stuff I point out is the general state of the emotional psychology of the human species. I myself tend towards a desire for monogamy but I think there is ample rationality to support the idea that polyamory may be a better overall social construct by which to conduct our lives.Friendships are relationships too and I think far too many people make the mistake of both ignoring friends as potential sexual partners and also the converse mistake of assuming their sexual partners are automatic loyal friends. I think theres a certain level of deep satisfaction that is achieved in friendship and I constantly hear people talk about a break up as having lost a best friend.Consider maybe humans would be better off if we completely removed the social stigma of who people have sex with when and why and the limitations and restrictions of only being able to have sex with a single person at a time. There would probably be far more opportunities for all humans to find not only friends but sex partners as well. There would probably be far more opportunities for you to have sex with one of the select few highly attractive people that you say are the only ones youre attracted to enough to consider having sex with. I think a vast majority of potential sexual relationships dont occur simply out of social stigma for not wanting to be seen or known to be having sex with another person for various social stigma reasons that person is a geek or fat or otherwise socially unattractive yet in my experience often times the growth of genuine close intimate friendship starts to trump those originally perceived problems. I think shallow is a term leveled by people who are probably shallow themselves because of exactly this reason that they know there are many people with whom theyd gladly and willingly have casual but really nothing is ever casual sexual relations and with whom theyd like to develop a deeperfurtherlastingintimate friendshipbond but they avoid doing so because of perceived social stigma and not because of their actual internal desires and also because doing so would likely preclude the possibility of being able to do it with someone better if someone better came along. As the saying goes the grass is always greener.Also given that we have placed this social emphasis on being exclusive to a single person at a time that leaves very little room for leeway in bad behavior and it brings about conversations and discussions on an order of magnitude that is blown far out of proportion to what normal people engage in in their normal every day friendships. While it sometimes happens friends far less often badger their friends to stop drinking than do monogamously romantic partners. The simple reason for this is that friends usually have other friends they can go hang out with and dont have to put up with Bobs drinking but Bob is still fundamentally fun to hang out with and drink with from time to time. When a person is stuck with a sexual partner there tends to develop a pretty intense desire for that sexual partner to be adequately fulfilling and the ways in which that partner is not adequately fulfilling are magnified far more times over than would normally be the case if that relationship were more like a goodintimatedeep regular friendship. So people try to change each other.Secondly lets consider the situation of human happinesssatisfactionfulfillment in the context of statistical analysis.I feel there is an artificial emphasis on romantic relationships presented to society by the media however caveats come to mind. Humans are an explicitly social species bears are not. Humans have grouped together and have thrived in communities and with social constructs. Bears are highly independent and very much a loner type of species. Not that there isnt room for humans to be quite diverse but I think its arguably true that humans are a highly social species. As a highly social species humans generally benefit from human contact and specifically from alliances known as friendships as well as alliances known as romantic relationships. Now yeah sure penguins mate for life but then again penguins rape each other and steal from each other. Im not advocating that we go out of our way to be like penguins but that we look at the realities of the proclivities of the human species. It turns out some people do desire monogamy and Im not saying monogamy is bad rather that especially with pointspositions like yours that maybe some kind of alternative arrangement is both highly prevalent within our species historically and also highly utilitarian. Most all close relationships and alliances might be good and beneficial even if not perfect. You can learn to like something or come to appreciate something that you dont like initially. People often are colddistant with each other at first and then open up as time goes on and they come to know and trust and see the emotional welcoming warmth of the other person they come to see the other person as another person not a stranger. Maybe the warped view of relationships that the media presents as so irrationally necessary despite there not being great reasons to enter them has to do at least partially with the fact that the media by and large only really presents monogamy as the main viable option and with the importance of intimacy to the human animal most human animals find themselves in a somewhat desperate situation to both fulfill their need for companionship and sexual release but also stay within the bounds and confines of the standard social norms.Now with all this said humans should be free to choose without social duress what actually suits them best. I wouldnt blame anyone who said I really just kind of like sex and I just want to be able to have sex with attractive people from time to time without the hangups. I dont think thats shallow at all I applaud the direct honesty of such a statement as it stands in stark contrast to the obfuscation presented by much of society and I think theres a lot of facing of hard truth there that a lot of people would rather not face or at the very least they dont want to be seen rocking the boat.Now with THAT said let me propose that maybe its possible that another factor is at play here which is the medias warping of the general publics sexual ideals to lust after only the most perfect bodies and to pay less attention to the quality of the interpersonal communication and emotional giveandtake economics at play wherein each party gives some type of pleasurebenefit to the other and that theres this artificial emphasis on only being allowed to do this with someone deemed by the outside observers looking in as socially normative i.e. attractive man attractive woman do the ooh ooh make attractive babies yay good.I think that in the calculus of love so to speak one should factor in a few things what are the chances that Ill actually ever meet anyone sexually attractive enough for my standards combined with what is the overall cost benefit ratio of holding out until you find such a person versus the cost benefit ratio of being willing to engage in intimate behavior and sexual release with a range of different people because such things are beneficial for the emotional well being of the human animal. Considering that holding out is really only a hold over from the idea that monogamy is the only viable option and that if people were more socially sanctioned and allowed to have sex with their closeintimate friends etc without a big to do around the whole situation that maybe the statistical likelihood of human satisfaction would be served in a far greater capacity.Also if its that easy to find sexual partners with which to be reasonably fulfilled there would be far less honey stop drinking kinds of arguments and far less enabling in situations like that. Also if its that unfettered to be with anyone that you deem worthy in your own eyes and society were to stop judging people as much as they do anyway for their imperfect and Im not talking obese cuz some things are still just badunhealthy etc and should not be condoned and no one should have to learn to like it body images that maybe more people would have more happiness in life and maybe relationships are actually quite a critically important health factor for the emotional wellbeing of the planet.'},\n",

       "  'arguments': 'To me it seems as if men have no safe spaces to talk to other men about things. Here are some things that I viewed as traditionally viewed as safe spaces for men Video games which were dominated by men for a while now have even genders overall in hard core games where women are a low percentage the gamer communitygames themselves are labeled as sexist. See Female character model controversies Mirrors Edge Assassins Creed etc. Jobs dominated by men engineering blue collar jobs etc. are being encouraged more and more for females to join. At the same time society is essentially calling these jobscompanies sexist because of the low percentages of women which has resulted in lots of companies pushing hard for more women in the work place. Domestic shelters are dominated in numbers by women with few shelters being available for men. Websites on the internet like reddit have the communities called sexist all the time and even now we are seeing a constant push towards making reddit more female friendly see twoxchromosomes becoming a default subreddit and pushing aside the male demographic.Anyway the result of all of this is I think that men essentially have limitedno avenues for places to talk to other men where as women have a plethora of places that they can go to. Any place that was once traditionally male dominated is being gutted but females still get to keep their exclusivity. ?',\n",

Id hazard a guess that rDIY has more men than women as regular contributors but nothing about that is sexist meanwhile rredpillwomen is presumably mostly women and is very sexist against women. Domestic shelters I do agree with as there are many places that lack adequate facilities for male victims of domestic violence. That said women tend to have a greater number of shelters dedicated to them because women represent about of domestic violence cases not quite but still a substantial majority.On another level lets break down what you call traditionally safe spaces for men Video games engineering and blue collar jobs and online communities. Why should those things be deemed for men only when theres nothing inherent about them that makes them inappropriate for women? Video games can and do cater to both genders women can be equally competent engineers and blue collar workers and online communities are for everyone who has an interest in the focus of the community to contribute to. Meanwhile what are traditionally female safe spaces? Womens groups womens gyms womens shelters all things that are explicitly created with women in mind. Youre pointing to gender neutral parts of society and saying that they should be for men why should they be? The Mens Shed movement is combatting the fact that an equivalent to womens groups doesnt exist for men and thats a positive step forward what isnt a step forward is saying that anything that isnt traditionally dominated by women should be less accommodating to them so that men dont have to create their own gendered safe spaces.'},\n",

On one hand it is sort of a copout but on the other hand it is similar to a game being won by a field goal at the end of a football game.Things I like about football which are absent in soccer I feel like football has more structure.

In football an interception or a completed pass is exciting. In soccer both of those things seem to happen every seconds. In football a game where one team scored once or zero times and the other team scored two or less times would be a pretty boring game. In soccer and seem to be pretty common scores.So please !

       "  'counters': 'Before I get to your points I think the most important thing about soccer is that anything can happen. Its guys wearing shorts and tshirts on a big field. Football plays only last a few seconds and they are so highly regimented that once the players have lined up there are only two possible outcomes either the offensive or defensive preplanned strategy succeeds. Often nothing exciting happens but fans are riveted because at any moment it could.They do in soccer too except they arent wearing pads. Not all physical contact is a penalty. And they have a greater variety of physical contact e.g. sliding body slamming biting.Are you saying this doesnt happen in football too? Games are often decided by one crucial penalty. Doesnt matter whether a player meant to make a false start the game punishes him for not exercising sufficient selfcontrol.Football coaches spend lots of time yelling at the refs. Anyway how do dives detract from the excitement of the game? Players only dive when they arent in an important position like after they have already lost the ball.Thats why people watch it.Sounds like the penalty shootout had an emotional effect on you it just didnt end how you wanted. Shootouts are exciting as fuck. And football also has sudden death rules except overtime is played exactly the same as the rest of the game so theres no added excitement.It does. Unfortunately I am as ignorant as you on this matter so I cant explain it. But like all sports the more you watch the more you understand the strategy. Football to an outsider is devoid of strategy just like soccer is to you.I do know soccer strategy is more exciting than football because its much more difficult. There are no breaks for coordination players have to react to the situation and communicate as best they can while they are playing the game.What makes more breaks better? All it does is interrupt play and give room for advertising.Its not random its based on how long play was stopped for injuries or other delays of game. The time in football is much more arbitrary a team can choose to waste between and seconds every single play and refs often stop the clock a couple seconds too late when people run out of bounds.Touchdowns goals. Passing and running are essential parts of soccer. Punting is like a goal kick. So of that list only field goals do not have a soccer equivalent. And there are plenty of other skills in soccer headers goalkeeping goal kicks corner kicks throwins free kicks and the walls players form etc.The action is reversed its more exciting when a player doesnt pass and manages to run the whole pitch alone.This contradicts your previous statement. First you complained theres too much action now theres not enough?Also you put too much emphasis on the success of a scoring attempt. There are plenty of shots on goal even though most of them are saved. Whats more exciting than a goalie diving to make a lastminute deflection? Arent turnovers more exciting in football than actual touchdowns? In any case football games are usually decided by the same margin one touchdown as most soccer matches one goal.'},\n",

       "  'counters': 'Okay let me give this a shot. Ive watched a decent amount of football and soccer and am a fan of both.First there definitely are different strategies. Playing against the Packers maybe before the last season better defend against the pass. Playing against a soccer team that plays a lot of short passes? Better press hard and quickly.As for time management thats a matter of preference. It really isnt random though. Theres a fourth official whose responsibility it is to make sure the right amount of time is added. Where football has structure handoff screen play action set time soccer is more free flowing. The players all have definite roles but its less obvious. You can have different teams with the same position and theyll all play that position differently.Soccer has different skill sets as well. Even within one position take a look at Peter Crouch and Lionel Messi Both play kinda the same position but are going to play very differently and have their teams use those strengths differently.Not every pass is exciting in football the same way that every pass is exciting in soccer. Or a yard run play. Somebody watching football after soccer might think the same thing but going in reverse. The passing and ball possession is an important part of the game but a lot of the time its about maintaining control of the flow of the game. And to me theres really nothing cooler than a game changing play in football but there arent really a lot of game changing plays in football. Sure a team might score but if theyre working the ball down the field theres a good chance the better team scores. Baseball soccer basketball football hockey will all have different amounts of scoring but they all have exciting play.And when your team is up with minutes to go there are a lot of moments where it looks like you might be about to give up a goal. To me the comparison is that youre playing red zone defense the whole time.'},\n",

I know it isnt realistic to just keep playing for forever but I was really rooting for Chile and I was really bummed at how they got knocked out.Things that I like about watching soccer Fewer commercial breaks. I really do appreciate this although it goes hand in hand with above. Global community. In football the Philadelphia Eagles is just as likely to have someone from Texas or Alabama or Oklahoma as Philadelphia. In soccer I really enjoyed watching the players get tearful as they sang their National Anthems. So awesome! Although I do think the penalty shootouts are a bit of a copout while watching Chile and Brazils shootout as well as Costa Rica and Greece I was definitely enjoying myself and on the edge of my seat. On one hand it is sort of a copout but on the other hand it is similar to a game being won by a field goal at the end of a football game.Things I like about football which are absent in soccer I feel like football has more structure. Theres more room for strategy there is more variability between the positions and theres a variety of different plays screen pass ground attack long bomb short pass play action etc. It may be that soccer has similar strategy and I just dont know about it. Further football seems to have better time management. Theres time outs quarters time stops on a missed pass or an injury as opposed to soccer where time never stops and the refs just add some random amount of time to the clock when the half is over. Theres more variety. Like I said different plays different skill sets for different players touchdowns field goals passing running punting etc. In soccer theres only a goal which brings me to my next point Theres so much action! In football an interception or a completed pass is exciting. In soccer both of those things seem to happen every seconds. In football a game where one team scored once or zero times and the other team scored two or less times would be a pretty boring game. In soccer and seem to be pretty common scores.So please ! I would really love to get more into soccer because I really enjoyed getting into football this last season. Ive already got my hierarchy of teams I want to win planned out GO USA! Then Costa Rica! Then Germany! Then Belgium! Then Netherlands!E Thanks to everyone for commenting! At this point all but one of my views have been changed and Ive bolded that above. The general take away from this as far as I can tell is A I need to learn more of the rules of soccer B I need to stop trying to watch soccer as if its football and instead watch it like its soccer.Thanks again!',\n",
       "  'counters': 'Firstly you are trying to compare two vastly different sports where the only real thing that they have in common is that they are both popular sports called football. Almost every point you make is either entirely subjective or shows a lack of knowledge about football soccer.The first point that you make is one that is bought up literally every time that soccer is mentioned on reddit outside of soccercentric subreddits. Their is definitely a bit of a problem with diving in the modern game but nowhere near as large a problem as many people seem to think. In fact in the majority of games there isnt much diving and most dives are ignored by the referee as they should be. There is also a difference between diving intentionally going to ground as a result of nonegligible contact with the sole aim of winning a penaltyfree kick for your team and either going down easily or legitimately falling down. Many players exaggerate contact its true but often they do take enough of a knock to go to ground and make a bigger deal of it in order to get the officials attention. It can sometimes leave a bad taste but often players writhe around on the floor in genuine pain high impact collisions hurt like hell but only for a few minutes or just to have a quick rest because soccer is one of the most physically demanding mainstream sports there is. You mention Arjen Robben and the penalty that he won against Mexico and give the reasoning that it wasnt intentional as why it shouldnt have been a penalty but intent doesnt apply in this case. It was both a stupid and sloppy tackle to make by Marquez and regardless of whether he does want to take Robben out or not he makes contact with his foot which is enough to trip Arjen Robben over. Robben does make a bit of a meal of it but it is the correct decision because regardless of whether Robben attempts to stay on his feet but cant quite reach it or he lies around on the ground pretending to be dead it is still a foul in the box which constitutes a penalty.The next point about how quickly things change in soccer is an entirely subjective point and for many people is part of the appeal of soccer. Personally I cannot enjoy watching Cricket or Baseball because even if there is a major upset it happens over many hours and you can see what is happening way before it does happen. This is not the case in soccer. For example a team which is multiple divisions below another team say Plymouth Argyle Vs. Man Utd could meet in the cup and despite Man Utd controlling the game for minutes a Plymouth Argyle st minute counter attack could turn the game from extra time and a probable Utd win into a memorable victory for the minnows something which is possible but much less likely in other sports including american football due to how hard it is to prevent any team from scoring points. This type of fast paced excitement is partly what makes soccer the favoured sport of most of the world. Just watch the English Premier League title completely change hands in mere minutes there is no other sport that can provide this much excitement on a regular basis This video also shows the passion of the fans which is another thing that sets soccer apart from American football im not saying that Broncos or Redskins or whatever fans arent passionate but they simply dont match up with the rivalries and the derbies in soccer El Clasico Arsenal Vs. Spurs the Manchester derby Brazil Vs. Argentina the Turkish derbies especially the Milan derby the superclasico the list could go on forever.Penalty shootouts are again very subjective. Bearing in mind that they are only used in cup competitions and the majority of matches are played in leagues domestic competitions e.g. MLS Premier League or international e.g. World cup group stages European championships qualifying or with a two legged system which reduces the chance of a penalty shoot out. With this in mind penalty shoot outs should hardly be a big factor in your enjoyment of the sport but also are exhilarating to watch anyway. Had Chile won the shoot out you may be singing a different tune penalty shootouts are great they allow smaller teams to cause huge upsets but even as an England fan I enjoy perhaps not the right word seeing as its so tense the tension of a shootout.In terms of strategy youre right Soccer isnt quite as tactical as American Football but that isnt to say that it isnt a huge part of the game. There is a reason that the best managers are handed salaries that are into the tens of millions in some cases and that reason is because tactics is such an integral part of the game. For instance take Man Utd the title winning team two seasons ago Alex Ferguson retires and essentially the same team comes th the year after something which can only be explained by the change in management no disastrous injuries player losses etc. Another good thing about the less tactics in soccer is that they are less restrictive it allows the talented players to improvise and pull ideas and chances out of nowhere allowing the greatest players to flourish and providing excitement for the fans e.g. James Rodriguez Vs. Uruguay Lionel Messi Vs. Iran Gareth Bale at Tottenham all pulling moments of magic out of thin air providing excitement and often leaving you in awe of their individual brilliance rather than being shoehorned into a rigid system. However tactics are often used in football to great effect look at Atletico Madrid in La Liga this year in terms of individual players they are far inferior to Barcelona and Real Madrid but the rigid and structured manner in which they played allowed them to win the league which was extremely unexpected at the beginning of the season.There is a huge variety in soccer you just need to be more versed in the game than you are to see it. For instance there are hundreds of different ways to pass a ball a long diagonal crossfield pass short tikitaka passing early crosses drilled crosses through balls chipped through balls and so on. There are also many different ways goals come about and the variety in this is partly what makes the game so unpredictable and exciting long shots vs chips headers from crosses goals from corners free kicks direct and indirect penalties team play cutting open the defence a fantastic dribble own goals defending mistakes etc. Unlike American Football where very very rarely are points scored out of completely nowhere it can happen in football which makes the game much more tense and exciting and therefore more enjoyable.You seem to contradict yourself in your own point hereIf American football is so action packed then wouldnt it be American Football that has something going on every seconds? In soccer the action never stops as cheesy as that sounds and anyone that watches soccer would realise that there is no need for many goals to make a match interesting it is the back and forth action and the near misses that are much more exciting than a rout. Watch the video i posted above for evidence or the recent win by Germany over Algeria a game which was for more than minutes but was an enthralling game.Overall at the end of the day whether you prefer soccer or American football comes down to how you like your sports. They arent similar in the same way baseball and cricket are they are two very different games one is high intensity fast paced excitement and the other is a tactical at times slow paced battle of wits between coaches. Personally I find soccer to be infinitely more enjoyable due to the nonstop fast paced nature of the game in addition to the how one moment of individual magic can change an entire game as well as the passion of the fans and players.'},\n",

I feel like theres more of a global following for soccer and that might have some fun implications.That said Ill get into itThings that bug me about watching soccer In football people often slam into each other at full speed. In soccer it seems to me that any accidental unavoidable contact results in a penalty. The penalty at the end of the Netherlands Mexico game basically completely decided the game and as I recall it didnt seem at least to me that it was intentional. As I recall it was almost unavoidable but it decided the entire game! One guy was trying to kick the ball another guy was near him and their legs touched and thats the game! It was so unsatisfying. If penalties arent being called on the players it seems to me like the players are constantly desperately trying to get the refs to call penalties. It seems like every time two people come within a couple of inches of each other one of them intentionally falls down looks at the ref angrily sometimes pretends to hold their leg in pain and in the case where a penalty isnt called gets up and continues playing as if nothing happened in other words they were obviously faking an injury.

       "  'counters': 'Part of the difference is slamming into someone full speed isnt as big of a deal as when . youre wearing protective gear and . youre expecting it to happen. Football players take hits sure but when youre braced for it its just not quite the same.Soccer players flop all the time too but a lot of their time on the ground is legitimate since they play with their feet its easy for an opponent to get tangled up and bring a person to the ground even if there isnt a lot of force behind it.The thing about this example is it was a weak penalty call but when the player was brought down in the box he lost a legitimate chance to cut in or pass the ball to a team mate and create a scoring chance. As unsatisfying as that is its equally frustrating to have a legitimate goal scoring opportunity taken away unfairly. Its on par with a team getting to re do the fourth down after the defense shut them down due to a holding foul that seemed like it didnt really change anything. Because it might have its unfair to not give the attacking team the chance to get it back.Yes this is a common complaint even among soccer fans. That said what do you expect them to do? When a player goes down even when they know it wasnt a foul their best course of action is to try and get the foul because theyve lost possession at that point. Not saying I like it either but the players do it because it works often enough to be worth it.I think this is a narrow view of the sport. Sure no goals are scored but that doesnt mean nothing happened. A perfect example of this is the BrazilMexico game which ended but was a thrilling match none the less. The Mexican goal keeper put in some incredible work in that game as he did against the Netherlands as well that was just beautiful. Theres a lot more to the game than scoring goals. Keepers make saves strikers get past defenders defenders strip the ball from an opponent. Just like in football where its not just about touchdowns but interceptions blocking a field goal or getting a sack are exciting to see there are lots of things in soccer besides when the ball hits the back of the net.You got that last part right. A lot of soccer is about answering the opponent. For example Spain is well known for playing whats called tikitaka where they focus on passing the ball around and keeping possession until they can find a hole in the defense to exploit. In the SpainNetherlands game the Dutch played a very physical game to not let Spain get into their preferred position and very effectively shut down that specific play style. Similarly Ghana is a team well known for their power on the counter attack to catch the defense off guard and the United States was able to play around this by playing more defensive than usual so Ghana was in possession of the ball more than normal but they never really got a chance to turn around attack with greater numbers. Theres plenty of strategy involved in the line up against Portugal Jurgen Klinsman used midfielders to pack it in there and give the United States a stronger presence everywhere on the field. The manager also has to know who to substitute for who and when since soccer is limited to only three substitutions per game its important to be able to see who is or isnt working well and know when it will be most beneficial to get fresh legs on the field.At the same time in football players can wait the play clock out and take time off the clock without even putting the ball in play. Im not a big football fan myself and thats something that really bugs me as in soccer deliberately not playing the ball to waste time can be penalized with a yellow card. Also when the amount of time the ball spends out of bounds and such professional soccer matches have roughly minutes of play time which is the same amount as is on the clock for football so the time management is mostly taken care of that way. The time added at the end of the half is also not arbitrary there is a fourth official who keeps track of how much time is taken due to injuries that needs to be given at the end of the half.Ive mostly already addressed the idea about the low score not reflecting how much action is in the game but the one last thing I want to say is that the lower scoring games also make each goal a really big deal which you can see by how much players celebrate when they do get one as well as how crazy it gets when for the fans.'},\n",

       "  'counters': 'Soccer fan here let me address your points from our perspectiveFirstly dont underestimate the impact of collisions in soccer. If you are running at full speed and somebody slides into you it can have a decent impact. However Soccer is not a contact sport such as football or rugby and puts less stress on athletics of the players and more on strategy. Sure the show is often annoying but a good ref lets the game flow and doesnt fall for the actors.Isnt that one of the most amazing things about soccer? Goals can happen out of nowhere and because the scarcity of goals makes them so important games can be surprisingly turned within seconds. It keeps the game thrilling and lets people hope until the last second even if their team is behind and not doing well.True but a soccer game is more fluent it keeps going. There is room for strategy but is has to planned or changed on the go which can be difficult. there are no constant pauses and anything can happen anytime.The time keeps running in soccer to get a better game flow and simplify the rules. Overtime pretends that the game ends in the middle of the attack and makes up for some of the lost time.On the other side soccer is more simple. Two goals two teams one ball. End. there are many ways to get the ball into the goal but you can only win by scoring a goal somehow during the game and nothing else except penalty shootout.Depends on the soccer game you watch some are boring some are thrilling no matter the final result. The low scores make the goals worth more and a game can be turned more easily. It also makes each goal more exciting and satisfying. What annoys me with Football is the constant breaks there is little game flow. the action is always very brief and most of the time you are watching people standing on the field or commercials.Hope you enjoy the rest of the cup.'},\n",

If the latter is the case with many of your friends then you either inspire great trust in people or have very weird friends.On the other hand if you see a person watch say Asian porn or you know that a particular person dates an Asian boygirlfriend and then you immediately assume that its only because of stereotypes they have about Asians that they objectify Asian women or men and even if its a real life boygirlfriend there can be no true feelings etc. etc. then it doesnt mean that person has an Asian fetish.

In West Africa there were many kingdoms in precolonialism. They had their own society. There were advanced societies centralized governments educational systems judicial systems.

       "American patriots have a general mentality against immigration. Saying these people shouldnt be allowed to become part of the country is the same as saying they are worse because they were born on a different side of a line and americans are better because of the side of the line they are born on. This is prominent in many ads and political champagnes namely the slogan Creating jobs for americans. I understand why politics use this slogan because they are trying to get americans to vote for them but this slogan is also prominent in ads made by private corporations. As if creating jobs for americans is morally superior to creating jobs for people of other countries. The companies launching these ads may be trying to win in the american market so they can sell more of their product but the fact that this can increase sales shows that many americans hold the being born on one side of a line belief. I am not blaming the politicians or corporations running ads running these slogans they are merely trying to win votes or make money from this mentality but really it is the citizens that have the belief that they are better because of the side of a line they are born on that are at fault. Patriotism is really just this belief."
