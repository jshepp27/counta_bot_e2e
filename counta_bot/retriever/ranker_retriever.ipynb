       "  'Bush had just been elected after a long run as Ronald Reaganâs vice president. For the most part, I listened very little to what the Bush administration had to say in those days. I confess I wasnât a supporter of his outlook or his economic priorities, which didnât seem to match with the abject poverty I saw around me at the time in then-rural West Florida and the poor governance in environmental safety. But that afternoon, dogged by the sweltering heat of a humid Florida drought, this particular news bite caught my attention: Americansâ wages were too high. They were unsustainable in the current economy., Bush administration did not reinstate them. During the Obama administration, opponents of Planned Parenthood funding sought legislation to cut it off. Their tactic made sense given the liberalism of the administration. Executive action gradually fell off the agenda, and even many anti-abortion activists are unaware of the Reagan-Bush history. During the presidential primaries, though, Jeb Bush proposed reinstating the old regulations., Bush administration was delayed by the Florida recount vote. (Bushâs first OMB director was confirmed Jan. 23, and Bush picked a deputy director on Feb. 6.)âTypically, during the first year of any incoming president, thereâs an understanding that theyâll take a little more time,â said Trent Duffy, who led communications for OMB during the early years of the Bush administration. Authors:, The first $100 billion dollar deficit happened during the Reagan administration; the first $400 billion during Bush 41; and the first $1 trillion deficit during the Bush 43 administration. It seems the only time Republicans care about deficits is when a Democrat is president. Another area where Republicans say one thing then do another is the size of government. The largest expansion of the federal government since LBJ happened under Bush 43 with a totally new department and a new entitlement program. The federal workforce expanded by more than 1 million during the Reagan administration., And therefore, it was not safe to appoint people who just happen to be Republicans. Why the Bush administration would appoint anyone who was a veteran of the George W. Bush administration is a mystery to me. They have a different philosophy than we do. Donald Trump is a non-interventionist., Paramilitary prisoners in Northern Ireland have not received appropriate development and resettlement services, an inspection said. Maghaberry Prison governor David Kennedy has said full and productive days were crucial to rehabilitating inmates. Criminal Justice Inspection Northern Ireland (CJI) published a report on Thursday on resettlement. It said: âIt remained unsatisfactory that the separated prisoners did not receive appropriate prisoner development and resettlement services, although CJI recognised that this matter was unlikely to be fully resolved in the absence of a functioning Northern Ireland Assembly and justice minister.âFollowing protests in 2003, the then government commissioned a review of the conditions in the prison which concluded that separation was necessary to protect paramilitary prisoners from opposing factions, from each other and to protect ordinary prisoners from the paramilitaries.

Bush as Treasury undersecretary for domestic finance, a position he held for about a year. Most recently, Quarles started his own investment firm, The Cynosure Group. For many years, he worked at the Bush-linked private-equity powerhouse Carlyle Group., Bush âtook a bold stand against anti-Muslim bigotryâ by delivering a speech at the Islamic Center of Washington, D.C. in 2001, days after the September 11 attacks. Itâs almost incomprehensible how one could look back with longing at an administration, which so blatantly targeted Muslims. Yet, in every instance that Trump or members of his administration target Muslims, the reanimated corpse of the Bush presidency is forced into the public arena again, and a parade of commentators tell a story that is pure fiction about an administration that only exists in their heads. What is it about this short address to a congregation of Muslims in Washington, D.C., that allows one to completely inoculate themselves against an administration responsible for horrific crimes against Muslims? Bush oversaw years of brutal torture and war crimes, the detention of hundreds of Muslims, and inaugurated the covert Controlled Application Review and Resolution Program (CAARP), which led the barring of Muslims from immigration benefits and their placement on a âTerror Watch List.â Nevertheless, Bush has managed to rebrand himself into Bush the Painter, the endearing grandfather figure.'),\n",

Aside from benefits to the country, though, social philosopher John Kleinig argues in 'The Ethics of Patriotism: A Debate' that patriotism may be just as essential to individuals as to the country. The concepts of patriotism become 'part of the identity we acquire and for which we develop loyal obligations,' he writes. 'It is important for our identity.'AdvertisementSummers are studded with opportunities to honor those obligations: Memorial Day, Flag Day, Independence Day, Labor Day., She is spot on about this. Labourâs affluent, liberal, middle-class wing tends to find the displays of patriotism during World Cups disturbing, even a tad repellent. As good global citizens and staunch opponents of nationalism they would never dream of driving around with an England flag on their car or draping one out of their bedroom window. They are fond of other countries but not their own.

The message is clear: Either demonstrate unqualified devotion to the United States or be punished. African-Americans confronted the same stark choice during World War I. In previous conflicts, African-Americans had sacrificed and shed blood for the nation. But patriotism alone has never been enough to overcome white supremacy., I see the decision by the NFL as an unmistakable attempt to police the actions of its majority black work force, impose what amounts to a loyalty oath, and enforce through intimidation and threat a narrow definition of patriotism.

In previous conflicts, African-Americans had sacrificed and shed blood for the nation. But patriotism alone has never been enough to overcome white supremacy., To determine what factors to evaluate, WalletHub asked a panel of experts a series of questions, ranging from what characteristics make a good patriot and what are the top five indicators to should children be raised as global citizens or Americans first and what schools and local authorities should do to promote patriotism among citizens. WalletHub bills itself as the first website to offer free, daily updated, full credit reports. Written by: Editor on July 3, 2018.

The ozone layer is in the healing process. Our nation and the world need a unified commitment, much like our effort during WWII. Our nation came together under that world threat; everyone sacrificed for each other and the greater good. Global warming is an even greater threat - just not as obvious, yet., But are traders being too blase? Looking at some of the red tops, you would think we are on the brink of World War Three. The markets analyse rationally, without bias or patriotism, and the odds of a global conflict are slim. Gold is the big indicator of fear and it is lower now than when Mr Trump came to power. It was a surprise how little the market moved when Mr Trump attacked Syria, which suggests there may be something else at play compared with the old days., The markets analyse rationally, without bias or patriotism, and the odds of a global conflict are slim.

       "  'In the opinion piece âSay Goodbye to Netflix and Net Neutralityâ published Nov. 27, the argument is put forth that everyone should have âfreeâ access to virtually whatever they want on the internet and that the government should ensure this. The argument fails badly for one main reason: All goods and services that people value and consume â including internet access and content â have to be created by people. They require capital and labor for their production. The claim that any of those should be âfreeâ is the claim that one should not have to pay for something on the internet produced by others., I believe we also need a clear message to the people of Europe, so that they will agree.âYour proposals emphasise sustainability, job creation, fighting inequalities and support to democracy. Could you explain the importance of these elements in research and innovation? âIn research and innovation policy there is not only an argument for jobs, but also the argument that it is good to live in a united Europe with these values. âYoung people must see they have a chance to work, have good education, to have good vocational or academic jobs. And we need to make sure there is a chance for more new jobs in new start-ups, in new small and medium enterprises, in new industries and in a new innovation system., âIn research and innovation policy there is not only an argument for jobs, but also the argument that it is good to live in a united Europe with these values. âYoung people must see they have a chance to work, have good education, to have good vocational or academic jobs.

So of the 14,000 voters, they listen, they make up their minds, and then they vote. To further make his case, Portnow pointed to Chance the Rapperâs Best New Artist win as proof of the Academyâs diversity: âYou donât get Chance the Rapper as the Best New Artist of the year if you have a membership that isnât diverse and isnât open-minded and isnât really listening to the music.â Portnow omits Chance is just one of five to win it since 1999. Lauryn Hillâs The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill won Album of the Year in 1999, the last time that award was won by a black woman. Portnowâs main argument is the Academyâs size means it is diverse., But they disagree with him on many of his policies, see the list above of things they support I agree with and which Donald Trump by and large disagrees with. What this represents is something that MacLean is clearly unaware of but which is important, that there is a major split within the Austrian School of Economics and among libertarians themselves, with the public choice people really on the side of all this, something that makes her main argument all the more ridiculous. This is the split between the Rothardian-Misesians and the Hayekians. The former, more influenced by the late Murray Rothbard than by von Mises really, have their great base at the Ludwig von Mises Institute (LvMI) in Auburn, Alabama, whereas the latter pretty much have their main HQ these days at George Mason University, precisely the crowd that MacLean has her story end up with. These former are much more inclined to Trumpian views on race and immigration in particular, and they actually fit her main argument much better, also defending neo-Confederate âPaleo-Conservativeâ ideas., We have so much more where that comes from.âThere are, however, a few issues with Ruâs argument here. Well, two main ones really: the terms âstraight pop cultureâ and âgay cultureâ. Theyâre not phrases that sit particularly well with some people. Specifically, people like Dr Justin Bengry, lecturer at Goldsmiths, University of London and convenor of the first Masters course in queer history. Bengry argues that the terms oversimplify, implying each person should subscribe to one or the other., We have so much more where that comes from.âThere are, however, a few issues with Ruâs argument here.

The details: Medicare, however, only pays for a personâs âmainâ source of oxygen. So people are usually prescribed the oxygen tanks unless they advocate that their mobility requires them to have a portable concentrator as their main source. So, speaking up and making an argument for mobility from the outset may be a good idea if you donât want to be tethered to the tanks. The National Fire Protection Association also has some tips on handling medical oxygen in the home., To further make his case, Portnow pointed to Chance the Rapperâs Best New Artist win as proof of the Academyâs diversity: âYou donât get Chance the Rapper as the Best New Artist of the year if you have a membership that isnât diverse and isnât open-minded and isnât really listening to the music.â Portnow omits Chance is just one of five to win it since 1999.

But the Academy does not release the exact demographics of its voter base, nor does it seem like itâs planning to, and one must wonder if the data really would back up his claim. None, âYou have to find facts and data that bolster the argument too. So the stories are important because they hook people in, but you also have to be able to make a logical argument.âBostock also emphasized that his job requires him to understand the personality of the person heâs writing for. âThe only way I can really give somebody a talk theyâre comfortable with is if I have the chance to get to know them, and to really get to know their voice,â he said.

ResearchMeetings, training and planning can take place anywhere. Do you know someone who travels but is vague about where theyâre going? Do you know someone with passports or other documents in different names, for no obvious reason? Do you know someone who looks at extremist material, including on the so-called Dark Web, or shares and creates content that promotes or glorifies terrorism?, The outburst came in response to a no-confidence motion proposed by the Joint List entitled âThe government promotes a policy based on war crimes.âLiberman, who is also chairman of the Yisrael Beytenu party said: âEvery day in the Middle East, about 400 people are murdered in Arab countries, nearly one thousand wounded. In Yemen, 160 people a day are murdered. Does someone care? Look at how many terrorist attacks there are every day. Does someone talk about war crimes?, âI asked the General, which group did he think the mother of the terrorist, who supports him, belonged to?â said Tamar Amar, adding, âBut he did not answer, he just gave me a look that we here call the Gush Katif look, which he gave every time someone raised a difficult question.âThe residents say that Numaâs division of the Arabs into groups has become a joke in the community, with people asking each other, âWhich group are you in today?ââAfter all, a terrorist who committed a terror attack while working in a supermarket belonged to the indifferent group and then, in two minutes, he jumped up two groups to the violents,â Amar said. âItâs a joke. One of the teachers from the village asked the General how did they allow the terrorist to cross groups without a test? You sit in front of a serious person and you do not believe that he really means what is coming out of his mouth.â None, Listening to members of communities, friends and families who might be in a better position to identify a radicalised or extremist individual is also of some value but it is inevitable that some people will slip through the net. How many times have we witnessed an act of terrorist atrocity for those close to the terrorist to be genuinely shocked that someone they knew and were close to could be capable of performing such an act of evil? Predicting human behaviour is not an accurate science. If we cannot predict who will commit an act of terrorism we cannot prevent them from doing it. We cannot imprison people simply because we believe they might commit a crime., âBut we need your help to exploit these opportunities, so if you see or hear something unusual or suspicious trust your instincts and ACT by reporting it in confidence by phone or online. âThat could be someone buying or storing chemicals, fertilisers or gas cylinders for no obvious reasons, or receiving deliveries for unusual items. It could be someone embracing extremist ideology, or searching for such material online. âThis new film has been made to try and help people understand recent terrorist attack-planning methods, but also to demonstrate that each report from the public can be one vital piece of a much larger picture. âThe important thing for people to remember is that no report is a waste of our time - trust your instincts and tell us if something doesnât feel right.âDetective Superintendent Glen Channer, head of counter terrorism for the Eastern Region Special Operations Unit (ERSOU), said: âEveryone has a role to play in helping to prevent terrorist attacks and we are fully supporting of this national campaign which aims to encourage people to report any suspicious behaviour., Don't use your people's lives to please Buhari ooo... 1 LikeYet their problem is Biafra 7 LikesHerdsmen they are terrorist.

When they do happen the police are going to be preoccupied with stopping the bad guys, which means someone has to come to the aid of the victims. And that someone may be you. CBSâs Rylee Carlson witnessed a demonstration in Birmingham, England and spoke with one of the people behind the app. âWe have to empower the public with skills and knowledge to be able to act in the first few minutes,â Dr. Tim Hodgetts explained., Does someone care?
