Marriage isnt a set of civil rights that confirms your connection to your partner its the choice you make to be in private daily lifelong commitment to another being.Tradition dictates that in order to be properly married you have to exchange vows get a ring and have a massive celebration the set of traditions change based upon the culture. But marriage isnt that it is simple commitment to another person. The main issue that gay marriage has is that not all couples are given the same civil liberties but this does not mean that their marriages are void. Marriage isnt decided by bystanders its decided by the people who live inside the union. It is for this very reason that a gay couple getting married doesnt affect your own marriage. Ive held this opinion for a while but have never had the opportunity to see if it stood up to criticism. .')"
