He took the position that they are unnatural. He cited this definition by MerriamWebster existing in nature and not made or caused by people coming from nature as his basis for the distinction for natural vs. unnatural.However I respectfully disagree with his position and furthermore that definition of natural. People arise from nature. Humankinds capacity to create problemsolve analyze rationalize and build also come from natural processes. How are the things we create unnatural? It is only through natural occurrences that we have this ability why is it that we would give the credit of these things solely to man as opposed to nature? We are not separate from nature thus how can any of our actions or creations be unnatural? If we were somehow separate from nature I would understand the distinction between natural and manmade. However I think unnatural and manmade are not synonyms by any means. It seems to me that manmade things MUST be natural due to our being part of nature.

The sentence in the title is an oversimplification of the view but Ill elaborate more here. Technically its a twopart view Explaining causation is not blaming the victim. Explaining causation is a worthwhile endeavor.Id be happy to have either view changed though if view is changed Id probably change my mind on view . Itll be easier to change my mind in other words about view than view Im not certain that its a worthwhile endeavor.Let me start off by saying that I understand the issues with victim blaming. Theres an unfortunate tendency that Ive noticed particularly on the Internet but occasionally in person as well to blame the victims of terrible situations. Were seeing it with responses to the police murders of black citizens people trying to find a reason why the person was shot and we see it with victims of rape people say you shouldnt have been so drunk or you shouldnt have been in that area of town. There are all sorts of possible explanations as to why victim blaming occurs one of the most convincing to me is that these occurrences cause a sort of cognitive dissonance in our minds where bad things happen to people who dont deserve it. We like to think of our world as just in some way so we come up with reasons why these people Deserved what they got. People rarely go so far as to say a woman deserved to be raped but theres a certain amount of otherization and lack of empathy that goes on a sense that well that wouldnt have happened to me because I wouldve been more careful. Additionally it blames the victim for something that you should be blaming the perpetrator for. And thats all bad.On the other hand it remains the case that the world is not a just place. Yes we can work towards justice we can work towards eliminating racism overt or structural and we can work towards a society in which women feel safer. And we absolutely should. In the meantime however it is important to understand lines of causation. Im not going with a very complicated definition of causation here basically a model in which two events or situations occur A and B and one event B would not have occurred the other A had not occurred. A caused B. Im aware there are logical or philosophical arguments against this model but thats not the view Im trying to have changed if you can make a compelling argument about the relevant views using those points go ahead.The case I often think of concerns myself and friends of mine. I live in a large city. It is safe for the most part but there are certain areas that you shouldnt walk in at night because you might get mugged. Both myself and a friend of mine have been mugged while walking through these areas. The causation is if we hadnt been walking through those areas we wouldnt have gotten mugged. So we dont walk through those areas at night anymore. Its still possible that well get mugged elsewhere but in my mind weve decreased our chances which is a good thing. We didnt deserve to get mugged before but changing our behavior prevented us from getting mugged again.Thus explaining causation is not justification. Its simply understanding the chain of events that led to another event.Finally my second view is that its a worthwhile endeavor. As I said we avoid those dangerous areas at night now and I feel weve decreased our chances of getting mugged. We understood the causation behind a negative situation and we changed our behavior accordingly. Ideally all areas would be safe to walk in but theyre not so we dont walk in the unsafe areas anymore. Yes this has mildly restricted our behavior but its worth it to us so that we dont get mugged. I understood these are hairy issues and maybe theres a fine line between causation and justification. .As far as part of my view goes I still stand by my original statement. Granted people have pointed out inconsistencies in the term causation but as I said Im not really trying to have a discussion about causation as a concept. I understand that its very complex and of course many factors go into a certain outcome. I am well aware of probabilistic models of eventsoutcomes my point was never to say that avoid certain areas means you wont get mugged or something like that. It concerned a marginal decrease of risk a change in probability. Furthermore the point itself was actually that explaining causation is not victim blaming and this view has not been addressed sufficiently. Ive changed my view to the point that I dont think explaining causation is always the appropriate response particularly in traumatic cases like sexual assault. I do still think its often important to explain causation before the fact as some users have suggested as an alternative simply to give people a good idea of what precautions they might want to take. Most specifically no one has really addressed this notion of causation vs. justification. One person has said theyre the same thing but not really offered an explanation for that. At any rate Ive enjoyed reading the responses so far Im aware this is a sensitive issue and Im glad discussions have remained pretty civil.'},\n {'id': 't3_2rmy6e',\n  'titles': 'Philosophy has no tangible value as an academic field of study.',\n  'argument': 'As an independent form of study philosophy doesnt seem to have any practical applications. What value does philosophy have in the modern age right now aside from contemplating things. Is it truly worth it to invest a significant amount of time and money studying this field? There do not seem to be any tangible applications or appreciable benefits from studying philosophy aside from personal growth and the expansion of ones intellectual perspective which I argue can be gained without studying philosophy in a rigorously academic manner. I often have read the argument that it is impossible to argue that philosophy is useless without using philosophy or something along those lines.I acknowledge this. Yes I am engaging in the use of philosophy right now at this very moment. However this does not provide an argument as to why it would be worthwhile to STUDY philosophy. What do you gain from studying philosophy that could not be gained from thoughtful introspection? Certainly important tools have originated from philosophical study such as the scientific method and science could be described as a subset of philosophy itself but that isnt an argument against the lack of tangible benefits to be gained from studying philosophy.You dont need to study philosophy to become a capable scientist.

Yes.So what if instead of killing off the lessintelligent people Im against killing. Of most things. we just limit offspring?For example we could use the IQ scale for want of a better intelligence measure to determine the number of offspring a person should be able to genetically contribute to.Like round the IQ to the nearest multiple of then divide by and thats the number of offspring youre allowed to create.So someone with near average intelligence near IQ would have their IQ rounded to and then divided by to make offspring. The total offspring is presumably equal to the number of people who contributed to it. A man and a woman with average IQ can have two children not each. and sustain their population.Conversely really above average IQs of can contribute genetically towards children... and so on.This would eventually make the human race smarter and therefore more likely to survive and advance the human race. I know this would be a bitch to implement and its near impossible to actually do but Im just looking at the concept. I know the IQ test has its faults and every policy can be abused... I know all that.Exceptions would be made when you accidentally have twins which causes you to go over your limit or etc. If a mother can make and has twins she cant make more but if she already has one and has twins after one which makes were not gonna kill onePerhaps if you have a major heritable health issue your IQ has subtracted from it before being rounded? Or maybe weighted differently like extremely high chance of cancer almost percent or something takes off more...

Something in the ballpark of of women who have abortions have more than one abortion. These people would have been raised by their incompetent parents to drain down society increase crime rates suck up resources and generally screw things up. Various ways to lower a resource negative population would have to be explored if not because of this million then because of the next million. One possibility is that there would be wars waged to try to kill them all perhaps even with other countries with similar problems. Waging war to purposefully lower population even with a country facing similar issues would cost not only resources but it would also cause political cultural and global issues. Americas innovation and education rankings would be lower. Every middleclass child in the country would receive a lower quality education if there were million more around. NoteIm not trying to hear arguments on the ethics of abortion its a banal argument that everyone and their mother has had at one point what I am really fishing for is insight into what the country would look like with those million around. Would we adapt to the population and make good use of each of them? Was view changed? Its a complicated issue. Without the extra population from abortions has there been proportionately more immigration to fill labor needs or are the millions of illegals from Mexico as likely to be so numerous even if there was a higher noneabortion population? Doesnt immigration of a working class citizen on such a massive scale cause dissonance in a country more so than it does cultural exchange meaning that it would have been preferable to have our abortions alive? Or are we talking about a population so huge that race and national identity are insignificant that there is always going to be a huge amount of hostility between different demographics? choppy writing but im on hours of sleep and stretched for time give me a break Side thought Perhaps the immigration of illegals is lowering the value of blue collar work and makes it harder for the borderline impoverished citizens to provide for their children. Its debatable how many women are having abortions due to financial reasons but surely its a significant number so how many of these women wouldnt be having financial troubles if there wasnt competition from cheap illegal labor to keep wages lower? This holds true even if illegal immigration is an overall plus to the countries value. Conclusion Mexicans are the supreme race native Americans will go extinct through abortion and then outbreeding. no that isnt a serious sentiment im just saying this discussion is abstract enough to go into some weird places and that it is necessary to have a stopping point Then there is the next question. Is a more highly populated and economically productive America today going to result in an America tomorrow that can handle over population problems or would having a higher population from noneabortion just add on to the problems of a world going to shit? Similar An aborted fetus is likely to have been a less productive person than a neverconsideredforabortion fetus but in an industrial society its likely that these abortions would still be more productive than not. Then there was the debate as to whether or not a larger population with less resources per person is more innovative than a smaller one. This is to be considered if one is convinced that having a higher population coming from noneabortions results in a strain for resources in the country.

A vegan or vegetarian diet denies demand and thus potential revenue to all meatproducing farms regardless of how humane or environmentally sound their practice are.a Since the majority of farms are large factory farms I concede that this is probably good for animal welfare. However Purchasing meat from farms known to produce their meat in an ethical way not only denies demand to large factory farms but helps improve the market share of ethical meatgrowing which seems as though it would be even better for animal welfare.My general view is that people should probably as a rule eat less meat from better growers and that will make for a bigger shift in growing practices than simply people dropping out of eating meat altogether.

Throughout human history conquerors with superior technology have succeeded over less capable and less innovative cultures. Its ruthless yes but the reality is conquered cultures were less capable than the victors. Therefor it is in the best interest of cultures to strive for innovation invention progress technology and science. Not only does this secure survivability but also increases standard of living.Colonel Quaritch as well as the other miners were there to extract resources which benefited this endeavor. They were striving to better their abilities through use of the metal under the tree the Navi inhabited. Arguably Colonel Quaritch COULD have massacred the residents of Hometree. It was well within his ability and means. Instead a chance to evacuate is given and Quaritches forces target Hometree itself not the Navi The fleet do not gun down the fleeing residents nor do they pursue. Their goal was the resources under the tree and not the extermination of the people.Next Quaritch ceases hostilities against the Navi until Jake assembles a massive force around the headquarters. Quaritch COULD have met them in battle but instead what does he do? Tries to avoid direct bloodshed by taking out a cultural symbol thus potentially avoiding loss of life among both Navi and Human. The culture of the Navi could have ended up like the Native Americans. Conquered but preserved through merciful reservations granted by the victors. Instead they opted for resistance and Im interested to see what the sequel holds for them.

And assuming the item doesnt spawn right next to a player you still have to make the dash to the item before someone else OR decide not to go for it at all. This is where the game becomes more competitive with the use of items. You have to actually take them into account. I imagine a common argument against items is something like oh well you suck if you can only win with items on. Have you considered that maybe you suck because you cant win without them turned off?I guess what Im saying here is that while items add a slight element of chance they more than make up for it with a multiple separate aspects of player skill.B. Even if there is a random aspect to the game...so what?Its not as though its a coin toss or a lottery where its based entirely on luck. Its just the kinds of items and where theyre placed. The addition of luck is part of the fun and part of the challenge.Luck and competition are not mutually exclusive. Even with items turned off. Its not even possible for them to be. Theres always going to be the possibility of an otherwise champion player making a stupid fatal fuckup or a glitch in the game causing an otherwise unwarranted victory. I understand wanting to reduce that element of chance but removing items does so to the point that the fun in the competition is lost.At the very least there should be separate mainstream Smash tournaments that keep items on.'},\n {'id': 't3_2r5o9o',\n  'titles': 'The term steep learning curve is used incorrectly what people really mean is shallow learning curve',\n  'argument': 'I forget where I first learned this but it has stuck with ever since and as person who deals with graphs and plots all the time biochemist it drives me nuts when ever I hear it.The term learning curve has been used in science since the early s according to wikipedia The term was used to plot a persons learning over their experience see example here The example here shows how a person rapidly gains proficiency or learning and eventually levels off. This could be a representations of how a person learns some thing easy like tictactoe. Note here that the curve is quite steep ie the slope is very large a large change in y over a small change in y. Here is a comparison between a steep in red and a shallow in blue curve. The shallow curve means that proficiency or learning is gained more slowly over time compared to the steep curve.Now words are often used differently in science and in common parlance theory is a good example. In common parlance theory means a guess whereas in science theory means a body of knowledge including all known facts hypotheses and natural laws relevant to a particular field of study or a proposed explanation of a set of related facts or a given phenomenon. In general when the term steep learning curve is used in common parlance it used to describe something difficult to learn. Eg The video game Dark Souls has a very steep learning curve. What this sentence is meant to convey is that the game is hard to learn and master which is clearly described by a shallow learning curve not a steep one.In conclusion saying This game is hard it has a steep learning curve is equivalent to saying I could care less when what one meant was I couldnt care less'},\n {'id': 't3_2r4u3k',\n  'titles': 'Nobody who works in a cubicle or other job where you rarely interact with anyone other than your coworkers should have any dress code beyond cover your naughty bits and dont wear offensive stuff',\n  'argument': 'To be clear Im talking about researchdesignprogrammingITcall center jobs where you arent in the public eye or arent representing the company with your physical body.

For example Thats so gay and You throw like a girl type insults. Many people come to the conclusion that these type of insults are homophobic and misogynistic but I dont believe thats necessarily the case at all.I think the most insulting thing about being called a girl for a boy is the affront to his own identity. He is being called something he is not. He doesnt think its insulting because he hates girls and thinks theyre inferior but rather because his identity as a boy is being taken away.Women in general also hate being associated with masculinity. They tend to want to be smaller than their partners because they feel masculine if they are taller. They religiously pluck facial hair and shave away body hair because thats manly. But they probably dont hate men.Similarly being called gay is a huge insult to many guys not because they are all homophobic but because they are being called something they are not.I think the best way to see it from my point of view is looking at how offensive it is for trans people when they are misgendered Purposely. It is a deliberate refusal of their identity. No one says a trans woman is a misandrist if she hates being referred to as he. The people calling them he are also unlikely to hate men but say it to hurt the trans person. So insults such as those above arent necessarily homophobic or misogynist.

Feminists often try to silence womens criticisms of feminism by saying they have internalized misogyny. I dont believe this is the case. A lack of belief in the patriarchy can be caused by the lack of empirical evidence. Examples of misogyny and discrimination dont have to be ignored or excused as one with internalized misogyny would be expected to do because they do not necessarily prove the existence of a patriarchy nor institutional misogyny.

The only time I could see child support being necessary is if they parent needs the extra money to support their children. But Im sorry you cant have a child if you cant support it and you sure as hell cant take the money from someone else regardless of their involvement in the childs creation. Obviously its a different story if they are splitting custody then an arrangement should be made about how the money should be split.If only the mother wants the child then she can have it and raise it by herself or with whomever she wants.If only the father wants the child then its up to the mother if she wants to have it and the forfeit custody to him after birth. If she does then its the fathers responsibility alone. No strings attached.I realize that its to stop guys from knocking up women and then running off and leaving her to raise it but she can just get an abortion if she cant raise it. Or put it up for adoption find a willing guardian ex. friend parent etc. if she doesnt want to do that.

For an incredibly cheap price or sometimes at no price at all you can listen to almost any song your heart desires or watch any movie that strikes your interest. Yes it is true that both of these services do not have literally everything but as the years go on these services will only get better to the point where it is virtually impossible to not have access to a movie or song.

However I believe that these arguments clash against each other and I feel that men should either be able to waive their financial obligations to their child or they should partake in the decision for the woman to get an abortion.Women should be the decision maker when it comes to getting an abortion because they should have control of their own bodiesThis is a perfectly valid point. In this argument the fetus is being treated as a part of the womans body and therefore the woman is free to make decisions without consideration for the wellbeing of the fetus and its future.Men should be on the hook for child support because we shouldnt be focused on the parents but rather the wellbeing of the childThis also makes perfect sense. Even if the parents are arguing the needs of the parents shouldnt be placed before the needs of the child.However if we take the argument that women should have control of their own bodies without consideration for the future of their fetus then it should also be right to say that men should have control of their own life without consideration for the future of their fetus.If we take the argument that the wellbeing of the child should come before the wellbeing of the parents then I also think that it is fair to say that a woman should not freely be able to choose whether to get an abortion without consideration for the wellbeing of the childs future.I find it extremely unfair that a woman who cannot financially or emotionally support a child has the right to have a kid because she has a right to control her own body but when it comes to men their life savings can be forcefully taken away because the future of the child should be placed before the rights of a man.Therefore I believe that men should either have abortion rights or the right to waive all financial obligations to his child while abortion is still an option.Note Im not trying to make this into a male vs. female thing.

It would be better to break it down further so that they are taxed on the first k on the next k and on the next k. Tax rate should be increased bit by bit as someones salary increases rather than having big jumps in tax rate. With a single formula there are no jumps and this leads to a fairer tax system.Heres a graph of a function which I came up with the very rich pay tax on their salary and those earning pay tax. Of course no one earns but this could easily be adjusted so that minimum wage earners pay and those slightly above minimum pay very little.One of Adam Smiths canons of taxation is that the tax system should be simple or understandable by the public. This means that the bands system is more attractive because of its simplicity but I do not think that it is too complicated to be practical. The function would not require more than so a simple calculator could do the job. The example I gave a graph of is just cS where S is salary and c is a constant that determines how quickly the result reaches tax rate.The taxing function could be evaluated and the public could be supplied with other formulae for answers to questions like If I get a raise from k to k how much does my income go up by? so the taxing system remains simple to the public.'},\n {'id': 't3_2qu6fg',\n  'titles': 'Making a product or service illegal only creates a black market which is generally more harmful than what is being made illegal',\n  'argument': 'Making something illegal doesnt make people want it any less there has only been a deterrent created.

However despite its shortcomings I believe that the real heart of the Mass Effect franchise lies not with the story or the narrative but with its characters. With only a couple exceptions the vast majority of Shepards crew are interesting fleshedout characters each with their own flaws and redeeming qualities. For example SPOILERS ME seeing Wrex grow from a mere gunforhire in ME to the responsible yet still badass leader of the Genophagefree Krogan in ME was one of the most gratifying experiences of my gaming career. Similarly the leap of faith Shepard takes when trusting Legion on Rannoch thus ending hundreds of years of conflict and bringing the Quarians and Geth together was immensely satisfying and could easily qualify for rfrission material. Without these experiences yeah Mass Effect didnt live up to the hype. How could it? Its such a hollow victory watching Wreav royally screw things up or watching Tali commit suicide.

They break the fourth wall if you will.Peter Jackson agrees with meThe main objection to this of course will be that the extended cuts are able to include more scenes from the books and are therefore better. Personally I think its a huge mistake to judge the quality of an adaptation by how closely it mirrors the source material rather than by the strength of its story telling. The LOTR movies are some of the best adaptations of all time precisely because they left a whole lot of the books unfilmed and a whole lot more on the cutting room floor. They stretched some scenes from brief chapters into center pieces Helmss Deep and cut out some of the more... esoteric portions completely Tom Bombadil.Basically Im glad Jackson opted to make excellent movies instead of attempting a shot for shot visualization of a book and I think the extended cuts subvert his success in that regard.Books and movies are not the same and in general the more an adaptation respects the inherent differences between the various media its adapting to and from the better the final product will be.

Wanting to make a profit on the dolls the boss then sells the dolls for each. She is now trying to sell worth of dolls but the only people available to sell to are the workers whos total funds are . No matter how they rearrange the money between them they will be unable to buy more than worth of the dolls and so the rest are waste inherent to the system and a direct result of the boss wanting to make profit.This example then scales up to the whole world when you throw in multiple bosses and lots more workers but the basic idea is the same if each worker is being paid less than the price of the things they produce so that their boss can profit then items that cannot be sold must still be produced and thrown away.'},\n {'id': 't3_2qnu4z',\n  'titles': 'The highest form of relationship between men and women doomed to be romance',\n  'argument': 'Maybe it has to do with being an adolescent and being new to dealing with the opposite sex but Im beginning to fall under the assumption that the only purpose for guys to get to know girls is to eventually engage in romance.Why else do men engage women in conversation in public?

Even Advanced Warfare which seemed to promise the most novel changes was criticized for changing too little from its preceding games.Another reason for my opinion is that CoD doesnt really have anything astoundingly different from other games of the same genre.

However the farright continues to be a menace.I believe fascist neonazi groups the KKK the golden dawn or any religious extremist group like radical Islamism all fall under the farright. These groups are always extreme fringes and a handful of people make the world a much nastier place.Often it is the leaders of such movements that prey on the weakwilled using them as pawns in their ambitions of power.Unfortunately with the worlds obsession with free speech and personal liberty such leaders are given a free hand. On websites like twitter and facebook we see ISIS recruit blind followers. Wouldnt restricting free speech put brakes on this sort of recruitment ?Political parties in democracies often try to keep these groups on a leash but do not wish to eliminate them since they serve definite political goals like polarizing the electorate. I see this as a major flaw in democracy. Fear of losing votes from radical sympathizers leads to political groups appeasing extremism.Instead I think governments should do much more and try to completely stamp out any signs of fascism.

From what I can tell there is very little skill involved in playing the game it just seems to be a giant crapshoot the whole way through.Monopoly was made with the intent to explain why localised monopolies are bad for the economy and to explain the Single Tax theory of Henry George. Though it does this job well I believe it is this intent that causes it to be thoroughly not fun. Once of the board has been claimed even if the landholdings of all the players are about equal it is immediately obvious which player will lose based on who falls in anothers territory first and has to pay the incredulous tax. After that it is just a long fall into bankruptcy as eventually the player has to sell their property to others decreasing the chance that they can earn revenue while simultaneously increasing the chance that the others can profit from them.While this system would work in a quick game between to people monopoly is usually drawn out and played with players. One after another a player pays out the networth to the other players until there is a long long drawnout standoff between the remaining few. At this point it comes to down to complete and utter chance. Whomever gets the worst successive dice rolls loses. When that happens barring any statistically unlikely dice rolls it is evident who will lose. But the game keeps going and going because it would be unfair to keep going despite the likely outcome.If Monopoly was redesigned to rely less on chance perhaps a redesign of the board more mechanics to tip the scales of chance perhaps with better Chance cards or even removal of the pieces entirely and to be quicker Add penalties for each additional player over so that the success and failures of each decision weigh more heavily for example then the game will be much more fun and enjoyable to everyone.

In particular The months are uneven. Its confusing to have irregular fluctuations in the length of months. Only one month having or days? Alternating between and lt days only to reverse at August? Theres no reason to have a complicated calendar just because some ancient emperors had oversized egos. has few factors so a perfect division is not practical but we can at least do better than what we have months have days and months have for example month would get Leap Day. Months do not line up with seasons. The equinoxes and solstices that define the seasons. Why have the season start of the way through the month when they could just happen on the first or second making that entire month in one season or close enough? It would also keep the months as part of division hierarchy four seasons to a year three months to a season. As a consequence of this change the year also wouldnt start in the middle of winter. New Years Day can be the first day of spring. Edit Based on some of the responses Ive been getting it seems like a lot of places use the term season more colloquially with summer just meaning when the days are longer and warmer rather than the space between the summer solstice and the autumnal equinox. To clarify this latter meaning is the one Ive going by. Harvest hunting basketball and tourist seasons are all regional but the ones that relate to axial tilt are universal as far as I can tell. School and financial years are misaligned with calendar years. Why have the school year when one could make the entire year line up with the calendar? This one has been answered Financial years have no set times and school years vary too much by region to try to align them with a universal calendar. View changed in this respect.These are the three particular objections I have. To change my view explain why these problems are necessary or at least why fixing them would cause other problems apart from the practicality of adopting a new system to begin with.I am well aware that actually getting the world to adopt a new calendar is highly impractical but such practical concerns are beside my point so I dont intend to argue about that. Im also not going to bother with appeals to tradition.So change my view.Theres been some confusion regarding my intentions here. I am well aware that the costs of switching calendars would be huge and not worthwhile for the relatively small benefits of having a more consistent system. However if I allowed for that consideration when constructing my post I wouldnt have bothered to post it because my view would have already been changed.The basic question Im interested in is this are there good reasons to have any of the inconsistencies that the Gregorian calendar currently has? If we were to make a calendar from scratch is there any reason to have irregular months rather than regular ones? Is there any reason to have the year start in the middle of winter rather than changing at the same time as a new season? These are the parts of this that I want to hear about not whether it can be implemented.If it helps you focus on the matter at hand heres a rephrase I have a button that once pressed will retroactively switch the current calendar to one with the fixes I describe above. This change is instant seamless and will carry no cost apart from the effort to press the button.

It involves not having to pay child support.Ive seen this concept floating around and initially dismissed it completely as guys wanting to shirk responsibility and be deadbeats. I also thought it could be too easily exploited especially if men got cold feet about having a baby and after claiming to support the woman decided to screw her over by taking the financial abortion option.However Ive thought up ways in which such a law could actually be feasible.. If intending to get child support from the father of a child the woman MUST inform him as soon as possible about the state of her being pregnant at least by the th week. Maybe he can sign a document saying he knows shes pregnant.. The father can only decide to opt out and have the financial abortion up until the th week of pregnancy. If he doesnt opt out by then he loses the right to opt out. The week thing is because pregnancy is pretty obvious by then but the womans body hasnt been morphed much it looks like. This can be changed I just based it off looking at pictures.These laws mean that a woman can decide with plenty of time left over for contemplating abortion if she wants to keep a baby and raise it as a single mom. If she cant raise it on her own she might want to abort with no great medical risk compared to the risks of pregnancy.I think it would be immoral to bring a child into the world without being capable of providing for it. I think it is also immoral to force a man to pay for a child he didnt want. If a woman cant raise the child without the fathers support the moral thing to do would be to abort the child.This law would obviously be relying on abortion being freely available in the area. It would probably be a very bad idea to implement it in the South of the USA for example.So that this law is feasible. I would like people to discuss loopholes extenuating circumstances and also if this law would be unfair to women in any way.

I dont know where to start...Im a year old white guy and straight Ive been single for about years now and before that I was in a relationship for and a half years. I think this is where I started to get bitter. I fell into depression after I broke up with her for sending messages to other guys suggesting she would met up with them for sex. I stumbled across some messages implying she already had but I have no solid evidence. I was a broken man at that point I dont know how best to describe it my inner self was shattered. I think I was like that for about months but its hard to remember all the days just blurred together. She had a new boyfriend in less than a week. I hated the fact that she could just be with someone else so soon more than I hated myself for being so God damn pathetic. I also hated that she told people that I was cheating on her and that I had other girls on the go the whole time. I still had her on Facebook at this point and all the guys commenting where the guys she was sending messages to. Aw dont worry about it babe he was a dick anyway. Do you need a hug? where among the comments she got and it goes without saying that this brought my blood to boil.But it isnt just her that has skewed my view on woman. My mother died when I was and me and my older brother where raised by just my dad. As difficult a child I was he did the best job he could with me. It wasnt until about that he met Helen. She was a early something year old nurse that lived about miles away. She would come down every few weeks to see my dad and spend time with me and my brother. We knew right away that something was wrong with her but being so young we couldnt put our finger on it. After a few more months my dad asked us if it would be OK if she stayed with us all the time and move in of course we didnt object because we could tell in the sound of his voice that he was lonely. Maybe he should have know better or maybe his heart was so desperate for love that he couldnt see that she was a fussy child that thought the universe revolved around who knows? So when she moved in with us it was less than months before she wanted to get a house that belongs to them and we were in a new home. I stayed with them until I was and I moved in with my best friend and my girlfriend and I was glad to be gone. My dad had always been very firm but fair with us never angry or over the top. As soon as we got in to the new house it all changed. It turns out that she didnt want to pay any of the mortgage that had been taken out in both their names. This lead to them arguing all the time. She it seemed just wanted to go to work come home relax and go shopping and housework on the weekends only. I dont think that Oh God its because she a woman that she is so lazy and wont take responsibility! because it turns out that she was still living with her mum when she came to live with us and her mother still did everything for her. Make her meals clean her clothes and didnt take any sort of rent from her. She was a stubborn teenager in an adults body. Now fast forward about years she cheats on my father and moves back into her mums house. My dad also fell into another depression and stopped eating this time and starting drinking. It brought me to tears the first time I saw him a month after she left he looked like a skeleton and he didnt even have the ability to smile. He told me that he got a letter from a solicitor of hers say that she wanted half of what the house they got was worth about I think even though she never paid a penny in to it. Its been sorted now and she is gone for good but over all this time I was losing more and more respect for woman.Then there is the only friend I have right now being controlled by his girlfriend. He has a son with his last girlfriend who also cheated and left him in dept funnily enough and I have to say that he is the most incredible father youve ever met in your life. His son loves him to bits and is so well behaved and respectful to him nothing like I was when I was his age. He sees him times a week and has him every other weekend he sees his family goes to parks and zoos and whatnot he gets along with everyone he loves life and daddy. The mother on the other hand while providing him with everything he needs and Im sure she is a brilliant mother to him has decided to move in with her new boyfriend in a new house about miles away and there isnt anything my friend can do about it. The mother doesnt seem to care too much Hell make new friends you can see him through Skype newboyfriend will be a father figure for him and yes she actually said that. He broke down into tears with this he loves his son more than anything in the world and to be told by the mother that you cant see him as much and being powerless to stop it just fuels more of this sexist view I carry. The mother is moving at the start of the new year and she hasnt told her son and wont let my friend do it either or I will just tell him that you knew he was going all along and that you didnt tell him. Im on the phone to him most nights trying my best to make him feel better however I can but believe it or not he only talks about his son moving away half the time. The other half is about how unsupportive his current girlfriend is being.Now she is only and she probably doesnt know how to support someone going through this. To be honest I dont know how either but Im trying my best. From what he tells me she is just tired of him constantly going on about it and not even trying to cheer up. She is the same as Helen is some respects lives with boyfriend who pays most of the bills always gets driven to and from work which his dad got for her and hates it when he spends a bit of money on something nice for himself.

IF YOURE READING THIS POST AND YOU HAVE NOT FINISHED AVATAR THE LAST AIRBENDER AS WELL AS THE FOURTH BOOK OF LEGEND OF KORRA LIKE WHY? YOU KNOW THERES GONNA BE SPOILERS. ITS YOUR FAULT. STOP OR BE SORRY.Okay. Maybe this is shitty of me as a person. Maybe Im just closedminded and white cisgendered homophobic I hope Im not but hey. But I seem to be one of the like three total fans of Legend of Korra that did not think the series ended the way it should have.Throughout the entire four seasons nearly every character underwent such major development. Mako used to be a selfish asshole who only cared for his brother and probending but at the end of the series he was an independent but caring detective who actively contributed to the safety of not only Republic City citizens but the entire Earth Kingdom. Bolin was an immature kid but at the end of the series he was a matured public speaker who fought for love and for his country. And Korra most of all was a childish uncultured selfimportant bender who didnt know what being the Avatar meant but at the end of the series up until as close as three minutes before the end was an independent mature woman who had learned so much about what it meant to be the Avatar on a global scale. The finale however wherein she is canonically as of tonight romantically matched with Asami a seemingly minor female character completely devalued all character development for her and wrapped up the show in the absolute worst way.. To pair Korra a seemingly strong female character with anyone at all would not do her justice. Avatar Korra is a strong independent Water Tribe woman who dont need no man or uh girl. She broke up with Mako in the second season because she couldnt be with him and be Avatar at the same time which is a theme consistent with The Last Airbender Aang had to let go his earthly tethers to enter the Avatar State. The difference for Aang was that there was a whole three seasons of tension between him and Katara so it was possible for it to happen naturally whereas there was at most being very generous half of a season of very vague and ambiguous um hey I like u for Korra. Even if Korra and Mako or Bolin had gotten together at the end I dont think Id have been as happy as if Korra went on being the Avatar as the strong woman she was made out to be.. To pair Korra with a relatively minor character who was only significant when it was convenient to the team regardless of gender is objectively bad fiction. I dont hate Asami as a character and I dont hate them being paired because theyre both girls and ew yuck same sex. I hate the situation because Asami Sato didnt exist for half of the first season. When she started existing it was to foil Korra which was fine and actually good conflict at the time. Then when its discovered her dad Hiroshi Sato was an Equalist and a villain she joined Team Avatar fulltime. She and Mako and Korra have had romantic conflict since season two but Asami was barely important in season three and slightly more important in season four. I say slightly important and not completely unimportant because she was relevant whenever Team Avatar needed a hiding spotbase of operations a plot weapon or transportation. But seriously Varrick ended up being more important to the plot that Asami and he wasnt even really Team Avatar for three entire seasons.. There is no way this ending wasnt fanservice. This show is the sequel to Avatar The Last Airbender a mature show that the fans called for a sequel to. The first season ended in a murdersuicide. The second season finale completely changed the world of Avatar forever. The third season ended on a terrifying cliffhanger. The fourth and final season finale? Avatar Korra the most powerful bender on the planet and Asami Sato one of the two most intelligent minds on the planet the other being on honeymoon go on vacation in the Spirit World and get romantically involved.

This situation would be further facilitated by the fact that the density of the universe is low in a heat death scenario as such it would be difficult for the machine to increase entropy via interactions with the environment. Think of it like this we absolutely cannot bring humans to the speed of light with current technology. Its physically impossible. Humans are made up of massive particles. You know all this.

A car or a paper towel has attributes than can be discussed in a commerical in a way that the consumer can understand. They use commericals to inform consumers as to why the product is a better choice than the competition by discussing what is done differently. Medicine is not marketed by talking about what chemicals are in it relative to the competition rather they show clips of patients enjoying life while listing a crapload of deadly side effects. Yes it is true that many products are marketed by showing the viewer shots of a general lifestyle that does not really pertain to the product but the difference is that medicine is far more complicated and can do far more harm to a person if purchased hastily than something like gum or a coffee machine. Yes it is also true that doctors get the final say it is only with there perscription that a purchase of medication can be authorized so then I ask why do we need the commercial in the first place? Why not just send doctors a brochure of the latest in medication? There is also an arguement to be had for the vote with your dollar concept of capitalism but in my view medicine is exempt from this because no one wants to have to buy medicine and no one who is not a doctor is qualified to say which medication is better as well as the fact that most consumers are not going to try a variety and medicines and keep buying that which they like the best as is the case with shampoo or food.

Im not even really talking legally though feel free to inform me but wether I am negatively influencencing the victim companys with this.This of course excludes remakes GOTY editions and other versions that add substantially to the game assuming you own the vanilla version. This does not include better graphics on PC or Keyboardmouse support.By buying the game on one platform I have compensated the developer fully for all the work gone into making it buying another version that adds nothing to the previously bought version is just paying twice the price for one product solely because the rivalery of companies Sony Microsoft Nintendo prevents crossbuy. Expanding on my personal buying behaviour percent of the time I wouldnt have rebought the game anyway and am doing it purely for convenience bought on Xbox torrenting on laptop so I can play it when Im gone too so the developerconsolecompany wont make a loss on my illigal copy and the other of the time I might be interested in rebuying a game bought on console for PC for say the mods which are fully made by people outside the company and do so for no profit and I still might just have enjoyed the game enough to justify a rebuy if the price is right i.e. I enjoyed the first Fable game greatly on Xbox and bought Fable TLC in a Steam sale for so I could play it again with mouse keyboard and in widescreen. This port technically has some added content but is also the only version available on PC I wasnt interested in the extra content and could have done without would I have had the option. Therefore I wouldnt have felt guilty about torrenting it but at that price I have no issue considering the fun and time I put into it already. You could argue that in theory I could buy a console that a company has been selling at a loss in hopes of earning this back in sold games and pirate every single game on it as I already own them on another gaming machine therfore have the console company make a loss on me. I think thats a risk you take when youre selling your machine at a loss and if that business model doesnt work for you change it. Of course the odds of someone doing specifically this are very very low and is but a minor dent in the tenhundred thousands or even millions of consumers raking in the profits for these companies. I would be no more harm to them than a person buying the sole console only to let it eat dust in the basement not to mention the fact that I have a perfectly fine gaming laptop and wouldnt be buying their consoles anyway if it wasnt for their exclusives which as the name suggests are exclusive to that console.

There are plenty of examples given from rappers who are very conscious and clever but even those hardly ever say anything I feel holds a candle to good lyrics from other genres. Comparing it to actual poetry I feel is a very immature argument and usually made by people who never read actual poetry. Also as someone who has played different musical instruments and rapped rapping at an elementary level was always much easier than playing an instrument. Singing takes years to learn well enough to do in public but most people can jot down some typical rap lyrics with ease and learn to recite them over a beat pretty easy.

Who are they discriminating against? White Males? As far as I know thats what the majority of the community is composed of.Secondly often times the content they highlight are offensive jokes and these statements are defended with statements like its just a joke.

Can those who like making jokes at the expense of others not take what they dish out?Thirdly and probably most importantly SRS is in my view a very necessary force of balance. People like to say they are a force of censorship but I dont agree with that. First and foremost for all the complaints about brigading very few of the content they highlight is downvoted into obscurity. Beyond that Freedom of Speech is only guaranteed by the US Government but not by private companies like Reddit or massive populations like Reddits user base. Being downvoted isnt censorship. You expressed your sentiment and the community rejected it. Nothing was denied beyond validation. Reddit is an immensely useful medium and interface for connecting to people all over the world and it receives new users every day. When memes like Opinion Puffin basically degenerate into a way for people to seek validation for racist and sexist beliefs and this stuff gets upvoted to the front page from being on one of the sites most populated subs it can give the wrong idea as to what kind of community actually uses this site or give someone a good reason for not joining which is sad because social connection is exactly what Reddit was obviously designed to foster.Anyway those are my main reasons for my current position. Other stuff may come up in the discussion but this should be enough to at least get the ball rolling.

Swear words are literally just words and most of them are considered slang or profanity since they originated from the AngloSaxon words. I do not allow my children to swear but every time that I tell them not to I feel like a hypocrite. The only reasons I dont allow them to swear is because I dont want them to get into the habit then let a swear word slip at school and end up in trouble. Society seems to really look down on children using profanity so I also dont want an investigation from DCF or anything like that.I understand that some people find them offensive from a religious standpoint but as a non religious person myself this doesnt apply to me and I dont feel like its a good antiprofanity argument since it doesnt coincide with my morality. My moral code is simple does this action harm another individual in some way? If so analyze the action and determine if the fault lies in the action or the person being harmed by it.

And with their retirement funds not accounting for inflation it wont keep them at the standard of living theyd become accustomed to. Theyll not only vote to keep entitlements going I wouldnt be surprised if they demanded more. The increasingly large percentage that wont have retirement to fall back on at all will likely need to live with one of their children who may or may not be willingable to support them. Sure theyll be able to live in retirement communities but theyll fill up fast and will drop in quality because of the increased demand for resources. And with so many grown children being unable to pay for better options the boomers will have to turn to the government for assistance. This generation will also be requiring more healthcare than ever in their lives. The boomers will demand lower prices better quality and will encourage as much regulation as possible. Itll probably be the thing that leads to universal healthcare.Yes in the end I believe even the boomers that will say theyre republican will probably cast democratic votes to save face.

This is philosophy reduced to mere rationalisation.We can see moral pioneers in people like Bentham and Mill both of whom anticipated relatively modern moral concerns such as womens equality under the law animal welfare and the thencontemporary issue of slavery.

Ive read things about body cams and increased accountability all placing a taller order for officers. Most of it to me comes off as basic cop hating and doesnt actually provide a reasonable solution that improves the amount of corrective justice taking place. In fact it impedes the justice system because it introduces external hoops for police to jump over doing their job. My arguments are as followsIncreasing police accountability increases police liability. In the era of social media one bad experience can cost you your whole career. This is true for every job BUT its exceptionally true for police who on a day to day basis subject themselves to this form of public scrutiny. I dont see this going away under the current status quo but I do think that adding more barriers to this particular issue destroys something the general populous values. Job stability. . Becoming a police officer like any other form of training is an investment and the current state of affairs and the proposed state of affairs will diminish job stability for police officers. This results in a net negative in effective justice because less officers means more crime. . It will create an upward trend in the riskreward mentality. Due to their scarcity cops will eventually lead to higher compensations to incentivize the fields. This is something present in other fields already where scarcity for the position exists such as medical nurses having large signing bonuses. This leads to increased police spending for less officers once again creating a net negative for justice.. The proposed things Ive heard such as maiming instead of killing and body cams provide proper closure for a negligible amount of cases but create far more gaps in coverage than they are worth. So its logically inconsistent to say Make cops more accountable so we can have more true justice. Raising the liability of police officers and destroying police coverage because of this ideology is not a positive boon to the justice system. Yes more high profile cases are covered better but their frequency is too infrequent to justify the loss of police force.

You know that they will probably be charged and you know the order of magnitude of punishment they will receive.Take a scenario where you knowingly wrongfully accuse someone of murder and they get the death penalty as a result. I would say that you murdered this person and therefore should be exposed to the death penalty yourself in trial. This seems to especially apply in cases of rape. While there are no doubt actual rapes that do occur. False accusations of rape have been used as a tool to destroy the lives of others going all the way back to the Jim Crow South where black men were hung on frivolous rape accusations.This tradition continues today with cases like the University of Virginia and this is what I believe and not the subject of this post Bill Cosby.

Jury selection in this country is effectively a rigged process regardless of the location of the trial the makeup of juries is almost always a homogeneous group of white suburbanites with predictable opinions.

It is a phrase all of us have used or heard most likely within the past few days. It is a phrase built to end arguments prevent yelling and provide a middle ground for those who simply can not agree. There are many cases that the phrase can be used for its intended purpose and remain harmless. One such case an argument is based SOLELY on opinion such as preference to chocolate or vanilla hot or cold red or blue. Another case is when an argument has continued through all other types of context and discourse that it has simply boiled down to a difference of opinion often dealing with some sort of sensory informationfeel taste smell etc.. Unfortunately the use of everyone is entitled to their opinion has shifted over time and is more often than not used in a visceral and spiteful manner. That is when the phrase becomes dangerous. The thought process behind the spiteful and lazy use of that phrase is what allowed cultures speaking mostly of the US because that is where I am from to slide away from a collective and productive entity and into a state of cyclical banter. My evidence of the danger of the phrase and the effect it has had on the culture is as follows . People use the phrase to lazily get out of arguments that are difficult or are in a field that they are not familiar with. They use the phrase to cover up their ignorance in order to protect their misconstrued beliefs. They will argue in circles for hours about something they dont know and justify the entire waste of brainpower as an opinion difference in order to move on with their lives without fracturing their beliefs. . The idea of being an expert on a topic is no longer valid. It is no longer valid because bits and pieces of info are so readily available individuals will allow themselves to feel they have enough information to form a strong belief without being an expert on the topic. The invaluable amount of time true experts spend in their fields hours according to the fantastic book Outliers by Malcolm Gladwell is nullified by the amount of perceived expertise that is part of our current cultural climate. . Factual arguments that can be argued down to a relative truth within the context of the argument are no longer explored. Opinions are seen as facts that are carelessly spewed from various newspropaganda organizations. The Everyone is entitled to their opinion mindset is the engine that drives the divide in cultural beliefs. No suitable and rational arguments are being made anymore because an OPINION is something that doesnt need to be changed as everyone is entitled to have one.

Is it better to lock it up in boxes or sell it to foreign countries?Wont the government be able to squash and oppress the citizenry by using this equipment? The equipment is given to local police forces though and why would they all unite against their neighbors? I would argue the opposite that the equipment actually better arms the common man against the federal government.The best argument against militarization that Ive heard was in Dan Carlins Common Sense podcast Ep . He says just the optics of it are bad. If Fergusons black residents feel that the police are more like an occupying force than it is their neighbors protecting them adding tanks does not dispel that notion.

This means youre forced to take a class with the risk of lowering your GPA based on subjective standards for art set by the teacher. Quality art takes skill the possession of which relies on prior experience. How can you grade someone who has played an instrument or acted in plays since they were a small child on the same scale as someone who has not had the privilege of doing either? In the marketplace arts value tends not to be based on the amount of time taken to create it. The classroom setting is the opposite where you can be marked down for a late art project.

So I am a firm believer in cultural relativism that you can not judge a culture base off of morals or societal norms you gained from your own culture. So we have example one that being gay is okay because we have seen it throughout history in many different cultures the Greeks being a prime example. However they also were constant offenders of pedophilia forcing twelve year old boys to give oral sex to grown men. We bring up pacific island cultures that idolize drag queens and transgenders however there are also cultures where the women teach the year old boys how to have sex. How can the first be okay but not the second. They are both acceptable in their respective cultures just one is deemed disgusting in our culture. We bring up animals point out how so many different species have gay relationships but animals also start having sex as soon as they are able to produce babies which is like twelve for us. Being gay is natural being a pedophile is natural we see both through out history and across species lines. Neither are the norm but are widely accepted in many cultures. However westernized cultures have deemed sex with children to be wrong. I ask a westerner what they think about pedophilia they say its disgusting. Its the same when I ask a homophobic Christians what they think about gay people they say its disgusting. Both are view points that have been instilled in those people through their culture. Since it is widely accepted that pedophilia is bad I feel like the gay community gets defensive and tries to distant themselves for pedophilia when in truth they are very much alike. Before I get all the messages of being homophobic or being a child molester I figured Id state my views. I am in full support of the gay community I have a gay sister that I love very dearly.

I tried to explain my position as clearly as I could and in cases like that my writing tends to take a decidedly formal swerve. Im aware that this carefully formal style may make me sound smug pompous or whatever other adjectives of oblivious selfinflation may apply. If anything I write strikes you that way Im sorry. I only ask you to keep in mind that it probably stems from love of precision and perhaps poor judgment of tone rather than from condescension.BackgroundThis topic is on my mind because its apparently been raised again recently in an episode of Aaron Sorkins The Newsroom and I just read in todays New York Times an article about the controversy that episode aroused It seems the episode involved a credible empathetic accuser and a sketchy offscreen accused so that the viewer automatically tends to give her story credence. Even so a journalist in the episode argues that it is unethical to publically accuse the man in front of a television audience without any conviction or trial.This seems to have aroused a huge backlash with articles published on Jezebel and elsewhere accusing Aaron Sorkin of choosing to victimblame a woman who was rapeddespite the fact that as Sorkin points out in a later quotation in the article he created this character to be a sympathetic alleged rape victim whose story has been neither corroborated nor disproved.Another quotation from the NYT articlePresentation of my viewsIt seems to me that in discussions of this sort people persistently conflate not believing ones story with disbelieving ones story as if there were no option other than believing in one thing or the oppositebut this distorts the basic fact that in a world where perfect truth is unattainable NOT believing in something is distinct from DISbelieving it. When two people dispute something and I dont have a good reason to believe one or the other my default position is not to presumptively believe either until the introduction of further evidence. This is a commonplace in most areas of human life but when the subject in dispute is whether A raped B it seems less and less to be taken for granted.Moreover I believe that it is extremely difficult to come up with credible statistics about how likely uncorroborated accusations are to be true for the simple reason that one is inherently dealing with disputed uncorroborated things and is very liable to fall into circular reasoning or a similar lapse in rendering the all important question of how to categorize a given accusation for purposes of his study. For this reason I mentally have grave reservations every time I read a number purporting to say what percentage of rape accusations are true or false.Furthermore even if for arguments sake one granted that the vast majority of rape accusations were true I still believe that due process as we think of it with regard to criminal accusations of any sortviz. innocent until proven guiltywould remain vitally important because its abrogation in any case would warp the incentive structures embedded in our society. It would be a very dangerous thing to create a system that provides an avenue for a false accuser to disastrously affect someone elses life while facing little or no potential negative impact him or herself.Summary of my viewsThe views Im asking you to change if you can are. It is extremely difficult if not impossible to know with any accuracy what percentage of rape accusations are true or false. Therefore assumptions of this nature should be given very limited credibility in the broader discussion of how to deal with a rape accusation.. The protocol of innocent until proven guilty is important NOT as a method of determining actual truth how could it be? but as a way to avoid creating societal systems that can be manipulated and abused by false accusers. As such it should be adhered to whenever departing from it would create a loophole for such abuse.. A common and misleading rhetorical tactic frequently used by advocates of strengthening laws and other societal devices intended to discourage andor punish rape is to frame the issue as if the only two possibilities are for us to presumptively believe one side or the other. This ignores the third most important possibility of all which is not to take a presumptive position in the absence of corroborating evidence. The false assumption that one must begin by taking a presumptive position distorts the practical issues at hand to the point of making reasonable discussion on them impossible while that assumption remains unchallenged.My biasesI should mention for the record that I have a tendency to think about things in the abstract rather than relating to them strongly on an emotional level an INTP personality type if you like the MyersBriggs categorization system Furthermore Im a man and do not personally know any rape victims that Im aware of so to the extent that I do relate to these things on an emotional level which of course I do too I feel more strongly the plight of the hypothetical innocent man facing a false accusation the position I can more readily imagine myself in than the hypothetical violated woman seeking justice.Im aware of both these biases and of course like everything else in our world of matter and men my views are also subject to Newtons First Law which states that to alter them requires a force equivalent to that with which they were previously held.And so...with those caveats in mind change my views please if you will any or all of them. Even if you dont succeed in changing them entirely Ill welcome any added perspective you can provide me and I believe Im open to that much at the very least.PS Support rolesA number of people in this thread have drawn a distinction between the roles of ideally neutral public figures like law officers and journalists and the roles of a persons support system immediate family and close friends suggesting that public stances in cases like this should be neutral but private stances should be unreservedly supportive. Id tentatively agree with that with the proviso that Id apply it equally to close friends of either potential victim of rape or of slander. Id add that I feel people should be generally freer to rely on their individual judgment in deciding what to believe when theyre not acting on those beliefs in a way thats liable to directly cause harm to someone else.'},\n {'id': 't3_2opfa2',\n  'titles': 'No One Should Feel Offended by Christmas',\n  'argument': 'Its the most benign and inoffensive festive occasion imaginable.Peace on Earth Good Will to All hard to see anyone complaining about this.Whenever I see Happy Holidays it gets me thinking.

I dont believe this to be true.I dont believe that it is the power that corrupts people but the fact that people themselves are corrupt to begin with and that obtaining a position of power just offers them a medium through which to act on their corruption. I do believe that the majority of people are in fact corrupt. So assuming you take a random person and insert them into a position of power it is likely that they will abuse the power that is granted to them. But I also believe if you take a person who isnt corrupt and insert them into this same position of power they will not abuse the privileges and power of the position that is granted to them.I think teachers illustrate this point very well especially because it is much easier to become a teacher than say the President of the United States. In this regard you tend to have a larger sample size and have many more types of people to consider. In most cases I would say that teachers tend to have absolute power over their classes at least with regards to daytoday activities. Generally if a teacher says to do something it is expected that the student comply to the demand of the teacher. If the student disagrees typically the matter is resolved at a later date with the intervention of a teachers superior.Taking this assumption that teachers have absolute power over their students you still tend to find a balance of teachers who abuse their power and those who dont. If the saying that absolute power corrupts absolutely were true all teachers would abuse their power since it is the power that corrupts the person and not the person that corrupts the power.Parents work well for this example as well. Literally anybody can become a parent as having a child is as easy as having sex. I would even say that parents definitely have absolute power over their children even moreso than teachers. But even with parenting you still tend to find a balance. Some parents are incredibly strict and unfair dictating arbitrary rules for their children that they themselves may not follow or rules that have no legitimate reason other than because I say so. Im not arguing the fact that sometimes parents use the because I say so justification even if the rule does have a legitimate reason but sometimes parents dont actually have a reason other than I say so. However you also find parents that are incredibly fair with their children. If a child does not agree with a rule set by a parent and argues his or her case fairly there are parents that would reconsider and change their rule for the sake of being fair. If absolute power corrupts absolutely parents like the latter would not exist as the power they hold over their child would corrupt them.TLDR Absolute power does not corrupt absolutely absolute corruption corrupts power absolutely.'},\n {'id': 't3_2ook4i',\n  'titles': 'With the emergence of the Internet selflearning is much more superior than traditional school.',\n  'argument': 'Im basing this on my experience solely.

Psychologically and physiologically our first reaction to aggressive actions is defense so resisting arrest statutes are legally punishing citizens for their natural instincts. Now Im not saying civilians should be allowed to resist with deadly force or even excessive force but there needs to be some protection for civilians resisting in a reasonable fashion. That may not be the perfect wording or solution but its coming from a layman. so the problem is deeper than policy its the psychology involved with the entire arrest procedure. My mind is still set that USA arrests and policing are ripe with abuse but the root is not these laws its the people and traditions.

I do not believe however that humans are direct descendents of any species and I do not believe that birds and dogs for example had any common ancestor. In forming this belief I have rejected certain levels of scientific consensus but I have never rejected any information that I felt refuted this. In any case what I am looking for are examples that prove that a dog may have had the same ancestor as a bird or something along those lines. I am not looking for the only facts that I have been offered that finches in the Galapagos developed different beaks.'},\n {'id': 't3_2o66aa',\n  'titles': 'You shouldnt tell someone they are beautiful when they clearly are not.',\n  'argument': 'Inspired from the link above. If you cant see it its a picture of a woman taken in new york with the caption that she only believes her hair and hands to be beautiful. Unsurprisingly the thread has been inundated with comments from people most of them women telling her that she is being too hard on herself that she is gorgeous that she should appreciate youth and other platitudes. While I get that these people are coming from a good place I dont think its the right thing to do for the following reasons.Its ultimately very condescending. What the commenters are saying when they say Youre wrong youre beautiful!!!!! is that is in capable of objectively analyzing herself and that she has to defer to strangers for that information that she cant discern for herself. I think its very clear to her that she is not a runway model and that she is a little obese so trying to tell her that she cant see herself properly in the mirror comes off more as an insult or a youre just saying that to make me feel better moment.I also think that its a good thing when people can look at themselves in an objective way. Very few people face their own flaws and never do anything about them because they are fed this love yourself no matter what BS so they go on with a bad personality or a bad diet and never wonder what they are doing wrong but instead blame other people Or in this case the media for their problems. I can appreciate people who see the flaws in themselves because then they can take the next step and work to improve themselves. In terms of beauty I believe that most of it is controllable through dress hairstyle and most importantly maintaining health. They are all controllable things and we all have the power to take control of that. This is what I believe people should put more emphasis on if someone questions their appearance. Tell them that if they dont like how they look then they have the power to change it and that you believe that they can.'},\n {'id': 't3_2o3imb',\n  'titles': 'It is in the best interest of internet feminists to make fake accounts to threaten people like Zoe Quinn and Anita Sarkeesian',\n  'argument': 'I think it is clear that the online threats directed at feminist public figures benefit their causes. These threats have enabled mainstream media coverage to create a straw man of any opposition to them and has poisoned the well for anyone who finds their views problematic that wants to have a public dialogue about them.

Here is what I came up with.Anita SarkeesianZoe QuinnEvery article mentions the threats and only two provide anything close to objective coverage of the controversy. The narrative for almost all mainstream coverage of these women universally supports them and an inordinate portion of these articles focuses on harassment from a small group of psychopaths and trolls which usually includes quotes of some of the most tasteless comments for shock value. Because of this I believe that the threats and trolling these women have experienced has greatly helped their cause. People unfamiliar with the games industry who read these articles are led to believe that a large portion of those opposing these women are psychopath basement dwellers making rape threats. Because this narrative helps their movement so much I believe that feminists who support the actions of these women can definitely help their movement by creating many fake anonymous accounts and viciously threatening feminist public figures with them. Drawing from this while hardcore members of Gamergate have undoubtedly trolled and threatened these women I believe a decent portion of the vitriol against these women is posted by their supporters.'},\n {'id': 't3_2o2kga',\n  'titles': 'The song baby its cold outside is about rape',\n  'argument': 'So basically my view is in the title.

If they were fulfilling that purpose we would expect at least a few percent of the cases they hear to not pass the test.

I dont think theres anything wrong with asexuality or bisexuality or any form of sexuality that doesnt hurt someone. I am biromantic and I can sort of understand being heteroromantic or homoromantic. But I have not heard a description of aromantic that does not make me feel like those people need help. From my perspective romantic attraction is just a natural extension of normal love like the love you have for your friends or family. To fall in love means to trust and care about someone else even more than you do about your friends enough to want to spend your life with them and dedicate a significant amount of your time and resources to their happiness and your mutual happiness. I think love is very important to being mentally and emotionally healthy. I dont think you can be emotionally healthy if you dont have any friends if you shun people and never express love. So when people say that they are physically incapable of loving and trusting someone enough to enter a romantic relationship I feel like something has to have gone wrong. Sexuality is one thing. Sexuality is about physical response and physical acts it is who turns you on and who you want to have sex with. Bodies are weird things physical reactions can range into bizarre in most situations I mean consider allergies and the actions people take are their own business again so long as nobodys getting hurt. But romantic feelings are based in emotion and thought and when something is very different with emotion and thought when you are lacking something that most people have that has to do with emotion and thought we call it a mental disorder. People who are lacking the ability to properly control their motivation and attention have ADHD. People who are lacking the ability to feel alright most of the time have Depression or Bipolar disorder. People who are lacking the ability to distinguish reality are schizophrenic or have delusions. So why are people who are lacking the ability to form romantic relationships...considered fine? Why is there a disconnect between the view of someone who cant make friends such as those with Schizoid Personality Disorder which we do consider problematic and people who can make friends but can never take it any further than that people with Aromanticism which we dont consider problematic?I guess the crux of my argument is that I believe there are different kinds of love of varying strengths. Love for your mom for your grandma for your aunt for your best friend for inanimate things. And I think romantic love is kind of the epitome of it something to strive for. Its one thing to not be in love or not be looking for love but to say youre actually just totally incapable of it?

Those who believe you have the right to use deadly force in selfdefense should also support abortion in at least some cases if not all. The main justification for being progun is that people need guns to defend themselves. Unique to arguing that people should carry guns as opposed to pepper spray or other selfdefense tools is that guns are used to kill not incapacitate. By being progun you are progiving people the right to choose to kill another person. A circumstance in which you would be allowed to do so under the castle doctrine stand your ground laws etc. would be that the other person is threatening your property or body. Progun activists cant really argue that you have to know your attacker intends to kill you as by the time you know they mean to kill you as opposed to rob you assault you etc. its likely too late for your gun to be effective. Ultimately the progun argument relies on one ordinary person being given the power to decide to end someone elses life without the need for lengthy deliberation that stateadministered capital punishment requires.Next the main justification for being prolife is that fetuses have personhood and deserve the same rights as people. If youre progun however youre arguing that someone has the right to kill another person if that person is intruding on their property or threatening their body. This definitively rules out cases where the mothers health is at risk and the mother would choose to preserve her own life first as in the infamous recent case of a woman dying in Ireland of medical complications after being denied an abortion. However it can be more broadly applied to other less critical abortions. For the same reason you would be justified in shooting to kill someone who is assaulting you or entering your home you should be justified in killing someone who is literally occupying your body for months. At the very least abortion must be legalized in cases of rape as you never consented to even the possibility of having a person invade your bodyproperty. This doesnt mean progun people are in any way obligated to personally prefer abortion for themselves just as they may not choose to shoot an intruder within their home but they should support legal abortion on the basis that others should be given that choice. A counterargument I can foresee is that to someone who is progun an attacker forfeits their right to life by being a criminal and fetuses are innocent. However this argument doesnt really fly. Firstly theres no way of knowing why an intruder has entered your home maybe they were forced to by someone else or coerced into it. Secondly even if a fetus has technically not consciously committed a crime it is still by its very existence invading another persons bodyproperty if that person did not consent to it being there. If you invite a personfetus into your homebody you dont have the right to kill them but in order to remain logically consistent you should be able to remove them with deadly force in both cases.Finally theres no corollary here because prochoice arguments dont rely on personhood theres no hypocrisy in being progun rights or progun control because its a completely separate issue.'},\n {'id': 't3_2nvxqw',\n  'titles': 'I am going to happily marry a man years older than me and I know it will last.',\n  'argument': 'I am a year old woman going to marry a year old man and we have been together since I was years old.

However it is better to stick with one term or another especially when little reference is made at all to Ancient times. It stands to reason that when it comes to referencing centuries versus specific years that the numerical system rather than the ordinal system is obviously superior we can both designate the s and but we cannot designate an individual year with th century.This system also makes it more difficult for nonEnglish speakers to understand as they have enough on their plate figuring out our mishmash of a language let alone how many dates they could get wrong during translation. Hell I sometimes get it wrong when Im not paying enough attention especially when it gets back into less recent history English speakers know automatically that th century and th century refer to s and s but how many of us automatically make the shift when we hear th century?The only issue I can see is that when discussing Romanera history around the time BC AD it might make referring to the st Century AD a little more difficult. However the problem persists even in BC with the confusion of the ordinal century lagging behind the actual year date. My is that this is a confusing system and bad for international students casual readers and even for historians and archaeologists. The below proposal is just a suggestion for discussion and shredding it as Im sure this subreddit will will not necessarily change my view on the whole subject.Therefore I think that when referencing these two centuries it might be more instructive to refer to them in a similar manner that some refer to the most recent full decade the oughts. Given that is technically part of the s this means that are referred to on occasion as the oughts when referring to decades in lieu of the s s and so forth.

My sister was speaking about leaving her money to her kids after her passing and I casually mentioned how I dont believe Id leave any. This was met with much more vitriol from both my mom and sister than I expected. Since my sister only seems to argue by using mindless platitudes she just kept saying you take care of your own over and over and my mother just kept telling me that is wrong without explaining why Id like to have a discussion on it here to see if I really am mislead in my views. Consider the following scenarioI have amassed a large fortune and have grown to be about . I had my kids in my s and so they are now in their s. My assumption would be that during the first or so years I have taken care of their educational costs provided for their basic needs and hopefully shown them the value of a dollar while still allowing them a life not bound by severe monetary constraints. After their s when they have begun providing for themselves I will be there as a backup should something truly catastrophic and unforeseen happen but they would be largely left to their own devices. After or so years of that when I die I would plan on leaving all my wealth to charities of my choice. I dont even think Id leave anything for the grandkids education as I believe that falls under the responsibility of the parents or even the children to properly finance and plan.The reasoningStatistics of the secondgeneration blow all the inheritance money during their lifetime. That statistic climbs to when you move into the thirdgeneration. To me this indicates that leaving a large inheritance to children who did not work for the money leads them to invest it poorly and blow it on frivolous spending Im not saying this happens in all cases as I know medical bills and a billion other situations could arise that would necessitate the costs but Im saying it is the most common reason.Ethics I dont believe that people should benefit simply by being born into a beneficial situation. Being born to wealthy parents shouldnt be like winning the lottery for your entire life. As I mentioned these kids would not feel the claws of poverty during their entire childhood why should they be guaranteed these lottery winnings well into adult life when they are supposed to be responsible for themselves? Moreover leaving this wealth to the children will actually negatively affect their lives as it will foster laziness and lack of ambition. Nearly every tycoon from Carnegie to Buffett to Gates has noted that leaving anything more than a small sum of money to their children would be terrible for their ambition and their motivation to make something of their lives.Some final comments I understand that this is putting the cart WAY before the horse.

ArgumentThe standard but weak argument I currently give in favor of an AR is everybody is different and needs to find the gun thats right for them different sized hands arm length number of arms less than two and ability shoot accurately all play a role in weapon selection and there is no one gun that fits everyone. So if some shoot better with an AR thats the gun they should own.Thats my standard argument but theres a part of me that still nags the question if anyone can train to use any weapon why is the AR needed?ARMy exposure to the AR community extends beyond just what I hear about on TV. I know quite a few people that have one and have shot a few variants of them. Heres what I think of them personally.What I think of the AR is its a bunch of expensive accessories attached to a gun. The accessories go with a theme or purpose of what role the AR is suppose to fill. If I go to the range and show any interest in someones AR theyll ask me if I want to try it then point to all of the little assessors they bought for it. What the AR guys do is they buy their AR then dump money into parts which they add throughout the year. Its like Legos except each brick runs about to and theyre pretty much all black. The gun seems infinity useful but ultimately become a range toy or used for competition. Home defenseNow home defense might be the number one reason people get an AR but I will always say the best gun for home defense will be anything chambered in gauge. And you can get a semiauto shotgun with a high capacity magazines tactical rails and with any kind of grip or stock you want. I think those are better than an AR. gauge is so versatile you can buy the right ammo for the kind of place you live with more flexibility than what the . or xmm has. Where an AR will over penetrate and risk hitting neighbors in a firefight you can get the exact rounds you need to protect yourself be effective and not kill anyone through drywall with guage which you can easily find at in most stores that sell ammo. If you predict your firefight is only going to be defending your apartment from an intruder then gauge bird shot is the lethal choice against a human threat and considerate of your neighbors safety. Yes bird shot despite what experts say. I know what Im talking about because Ive screwed around a lot with gauge bird shot and at feet you can cut through a x block of wood with the cheap stuff. If youre not worried about neighbors you can get slugs or buckshot. So an AR might be a good choice for home defense but its more expensive than the best choice for home defense. AUprisingIs the AR a necessary part of the nd amendment? I think the U.S. would collapse before wed get a chance to overthrow it. But if we did wed depend on our military going AWOL first then wed have a fighting chance. It also would be bloody.

I personally think the drugs that are illegal should be the worst in terms of dependence and bodily harm. For instance I personally dont use marijuana but I believe its ridiculous that cannabis use is illegal while alcohol and tobacco much more harmful and addictive drugs are legal. This applies to crack heroin powder cocaine crystal methamphetamine etc. Im opposed to the legalization of drugs that have much higher addiction potential and are much more bodily harmful than drugs that are currently legal. I also do think its a good idea to focus more state effort on addiction recovery.The main argument for the legalization of ALL substances is that it will allegedly curb the power of drug cartels that commit horrendous acts of violence all over the world. Ive heard a lot of vague arguments that we should tax and regulate these drugs in order to curb abuse while cutting cartel profits. These two goals are generally at odds with each other. Any effective method of undercutting cartels will make hard drugs more available to everyone. You can regulate them all you want but youll only accomplish the intended purpose of cutting profits to drug cartels if you make cocaine and heroin easier to get elsewhere. I believe that there will be more addicts and heavy drug users if this is the case.Currently there are more tobacco and alcohol users in the US than marijuana users and I credit that to the fact that marijuana is illegal and harder to get.

Imagine if cocaine and heroin were sold in stores like tobacco is now. Would you feel safe going to the store knowing that an addict might be holding it up for his fix? Would you feel safe letting your kids go to college knowing that a senior could purchase them a lifelong addiction and possible early death at the ?I understand that many children already live in an environment where drugs are readily available but millions of others are stopped from using hard drugs by the presence of the law and we need to stop and think whether we want to give that away over libertarian principles or possible mitigation of street violence. As for the libertarian argument that its a state infringement upon rights I personally find rights to be a bit more nuanced than that and the most simplyworded right isnt always the one that should prevail in a given situation. In this case I consider my right to protection from addicts and addictive substances more important than others rights to use those substances. There are horrible costs to the War on Drugs but I dont see any feasible alternative in the realm of legalizing all addictive substances.'},\n {'id': 't3_2nfgyu',\n  'titles': 'Police should be required to use dash cameras and wear body cameras at all times.',\n  'argument': 'This would serve the dual purpose of holding cops accountable in the event of fuckery and vindicating any use of force if justified.

That along with the witness testimonies for the most part saying he had surrendered and still was shot constitutes man slaughter. Due to the conflicting testimonies though he couldnt be charged with murder. Not to mention this all started with Brown robbing a store. The video of Brown stealing the cigarillos shows him aggressively shoving the convenience store clerk as he attempted to confront him. This doesnt seem like the temperament of a guy who would just surrender when confronted by a police officer not to imply that he didnt. Now to the point! I have no idea what happened on that day and how it all unfolded. I have no idea what the motivations of the police officer were. I have no idea if Brown actually grabbed at the gun of the officer. No one does. But all I am hearing about is how certain everyone is that is was somehow racially motivated. I understand it is totally possible that it was racially motivated or influenced in some way. But it is also equally possible that it was simply a matter of circumstance in which someone who had just robbed a store got too aggressive with a police officer and hasty decisions had to be made. I just feel that it is way too easy to mark up such a complex confrontation to a racially motivated slaughtering as a lot of people are acting like especially when nothing would have likely happened had Brown not initiated confrontation with police by robbing a store. I think it is much more likely that the officer simply had to make a hasty decision and went a bit over the top. Maybe I have misunderstandings about the facts and if that is the case PLEASE let me know. All in all I just think that it is a cop out to pull the race card on an incident in which literally no one except the people who were there know exactly what happened.

The prosecutor himself admitted during the case that a lot of witnesses changed their stories multiple times usually after being contacted by the media.

I dont know if it was or wasnt and I am not here to argue that. But because the media insisted that it was before they could confirm that with facts citizens across the country especially in Ferguson believed it. That helped spark the protests which in turn opened the door to looters taking advantage of the situation and destroying peoples lives in the process.

If they push the issue Im happy to concede and change my pronunciation during the rest of the conversation but I still find their insistence mildly offensive. Im aware Im in a particular country that speaks English a certain way but to completely discount alternate and in many cases the original pronunciation as wrong seems nationalistic at best and conceited at worst. Everyone should be mindful of the culture they are in and I can see how I might come across as aloof but I dont do this to be different I do this because I am different just as anyone from any other nationality is different. Its not an attempt to subvert American pronunciation as wrong because it is just as right as any other nations pronunciation. If I could just chalk this up to nationalism I would accept it and move on as just a facet of American culture. However it feels like its just aimed at me.

Because of this I always explain my accent in the context of where I grew up Missouri and my mother teaching me to speak I grew up using Australian slang though I often did not learn it was Australian only until much later in life. I have since for the most part stopped using the slang because it requires explaining whole new words. My pronunciation on the other hand is inherently a part of my accent and because I have to explain that just about every time I meet someone in my mind justifies my pronunciation. I do not think that the British pronunciation is any more right than the American it was a mistake in my part to say it was original.

They say that because Im American and was raised in America I should sound American.

A voluntary agreement cant be slavery. People have the choice to deny the job we offer.Which is correct. But also a bit naive. People are prepared to work very hard for very little. Corporations know this and it would be very difficult indeed to find a job anywhere where the employer would be kind enough to provide more than the bare minimum. Yes it will be voluntary. But will that make it any less cruel?But thats not my problem with libertarianism. seeing as you can argue that the benefits will outway the costs people will somehow unanimously refuse the lowest wages etc. My main point is that Libertarianism is contradictory. And heres why the government is fundamentally no different from a corporation providing services. Only here the services are police forces roads health care and all in all society itself. There is only one real difference and that is that in a democratic government citizens can elect their CEOsIf you as a CEO dont like the rules and taxes the government asks in return for allowing you to use its services you should just move your corporation to a different country. Or start your own. But of course you wont do that because you lack the resources or because you need the benefits of your country for keeping your corporation alive. Why its not a choice at all! Well welcome to the situation of a labourer faced with a free market. You have a choice. Kind of. Only its not a choice at all. If you truly consider this sort of voluntary interaction fair then you must also accept that you have no right to complain about the current status quo.

You go to buy a given good and find two choices one of which is slightly more expensive than the other but promises that it was produced using Sustainable forestry or the like. Now there are several problems with this. First of all given that the Green option is more expensive at no actual added utility to the enduser such consumerism is limited more to higherincome people who often buy not just for utility but for cosmetic luxury and an appearance of being environmentallyfriendly. In practice this means that ethical consumerism is at best a mostlyirrelevant niche market a lonely island in a sea of unethical behavior.Secondly it puts the impetus on the consumer not on the corporation to determine the responsible use of resources. A common argument used by libertarians is that issues like climate change and the globalized exploitation of sweatshop labor are selflimiting problems as people will generally prefer the more humanitarian purchase.

My entire life I was the stereotypical nice guy who always cared about the feelings of others so much so that I would invite kids sitting alone at lunch to my table I would hang out with my friends if they seemed like they needed someone to talk to etc. My mom instilled in me from a very young age that above all I should respect women and that was the way to find love. Hold the door open for her be polite and courteousbuy her flowers etc. Anyways last year I met what seemed like the perfect girl. Beautiful funny ditzy intelligent basically everything I could ever want in a girl. Back then I believed there was a distinction between party rats and nice girls and she seemed to embody essentially everything about the nice girl. Well we made plans to hang out one night and she flaked on me. Then I found out the reason that she flaked to fuck the football teams th string running back who was known around campus as a player and had fucked like girls already first months of college. I stopped talking to her after that. As soon as she found a better option she just left me in the dust and never showed any regret for ditching me.The point Im trying to make is this most girls I have met in college have behaved this way. Even the ones I would never expect it from and the ones who said they werent that girl and wanted a nice guy. I used to laugh at nice guys on the internet but now I really feel for them. Im not ugly by any means and Ive had a little success but it was only when I pretended to be someone who Im not and basically acted like the girl didnt exist until the night we hooked up. I HATE acting like this but based on my experiences it seems like the only way. Do women really hope to find a nice guy? Because Im calling bullshit.

I believe that life is in fact an accident and that our existence is coincidental. Being so I also dont believe in eternal truths mainly in the notion that there is an inherent good that people should be trying to attain. If any purpose exists it is constructed within the person for otherwise why would people exist? It is not to serve nature surely for humans ultimately oppose nature especially in modern society. In the case that there was a God I suppose one could argue that we exists for the Gods sake but why? For entertainment? I am really not clear how purpose can be inherent and not constructed. The same goes for the greater good. There does not seem to be a good that exists from with out the person or societies. If there were a greater objective good why then with the exception of murder and incest are very few things seen as universally bad among all societys? And why are few things seen as universally good? For example in America it is seen as wrong to arrange a marriage especially among children under . But in many countries that is the standard. If a universal good exists how come there is so much variance as to what is right and wrong?However I believe this to be a good thing. As opposed to more traditional nihilism which equates meaningless to life being futile I believe that the lack of a notion of a greater good or purpose is a freeing thing. With no greater purpose or greater good one can construct it for oneself. The most important thing becomes ones personal experience in the world and maximizing that to its full potential. There is no worry of not meeting a cosmic standard the standards are within yourself. And so a person does not have to be limited from most any experience unless they so desire it.As such I would categorize myself as an ethical hedonist without any inherent purpose experience is the most important thing and pleasurable experience being the greatest kind of experience one should strive for that for themselves. However because all people are on this journey one persons search for pleasure cannot infringe on another. I fully believe if everyone felt this way society would be more functional as everyone would be operating on the basis of mutual respect. So Reddit Change My View about any and all of these things. Life having a purpose. The existence of an inherent good. The absence of these being freeing. The idea that if ethical hedonism were the standard society would be more functional.

A simplified version of this theory because of the last item is conservatives are motivated by disgust reactions.My point is the problem is that Haidts methodology is flawed because he assumed the same things will effect a disgust reaction in liberals and conservatives. It is not true. His questions are too much conservative focused e.g. desecrating a flag. Liberals are simply disgusted by different things for example desecreating knowledge burning books or libraries.I think liberals feel more disgust over violence and blood for example. It is not simply a careharm thing I think perfectly voluntary violence like an MMA match with some blood will disgust liberals more than conservatives.Similarly ask them about how they feel about shooting a dog who is in incurable pain and debilitating disability and therefore it is a caring not harmful act liberals will feel more disgusted by it.So if you balance your questions properly you take into account different kinds of disgust you dont find liberals are less motivated by disgust than conservatives.Similarly it is not that liberals are less likely to respect authority but more like they respect different authorities the police less and scientists more.In loyalty Haidt focuses too much on loyalty to your nation or family and not your political movement or social class.

Obviously music enjoyment is not some scientific enterprise. There is music that I dont enjoy listening to but understand how others could or see quality that I can appreciate. Likewise everyone has those guilty pleasure artistssongs where we know theyre bad but love them anyway. In either case there is something about the music that we find good whether an infectious melody or wellconstructed lyrics or a wailing solo.Which returns me to trap. I find nothing about it aesthetically or musically appealing. I cant relegate it to Im not into it but can see why others do because I cant see why others like it which is why I turn to you Reddit. My objections are as follows Minimalism works against it. Minimalism in music is not always bad. I listen to other Electrohouse or DnB artists who use it to great effect. It creates a great tensionandrelease element to a song and when used well is orgasmic. This tension is a staple in the Trap sound replacing the forceful Dubstep drop for a super low drone with a high minimalistic melody generally speaking. On an subjective level this is musical blue balls but I think I can make a case for this on a more objective level. The reason the EDM staple of builddrop works is because of the tensionrelease cycle. Its like those amusement park rides that take you up feet and then well drop you. The exhilaration and force of the drop is sharpened by the slow buildup. Trap on the other hand employs an almost identical build and then the contrasted lack of sound at the drop serves as a different kind of experience. Imagine if instead of dropping the full feet the ride drops you feet. You dont expect the stop and theres this juxtaposition of released tension and even more anticipation. Trap as a genre embraces this latter example as its core never rleasing the tension fully. As a result instead of effectively building a proper tensionrelease cycle Trap leaves the listener unfulfilled.Possible rebuttal to The amusement park model doesnt work for Trap. In that case what is a better model with which to consider Trap? Absence of complexity. Im not looking for Mozart the DJ. Just something that gives the illusion of compositional knowhow. note melodies are firstly boring and secondly a sign that the producer has no musical talent. I would like skill in my music. Trap as a genre feeds the instrumentalfetishist argument that electrobic music takes no skill because they dont play a real instrument. EDM can do so much more and Ive heard it do so much more. Just never in this genre.Possible rebuttal to aYoure just being a snob and using it as an excuse for your subjective dislike. Possibly but I dont think so. Even if the bar were set really low like One Direction low maybe the best choruses of Trap that are distinctly Trap not simply elements of other EDM genres which automatically set the majority of trap above D could surpass them in terms of quality. Maybe. bOther genres have plenty of unremarkable musical complexity. Agreed however no genre aside from Ambient Drone makes melodic simplicity a defining feature of the genre itself. c Simplicity is not always bad. Agreed. Some composers use simplicity very well and for a variety of aesthetic effects. My argument is that Trap does not.Its likely that I wont enjoy Trap music after this thread but I do want to understand those that do like it and if they like it whether they actually think it constitutes quality music. Thank you.Example This is a fairly standard in my mind example of Trap elements. steady drone with highhats composing the background for a melody of lets face it one note with some ornaments.Example Remix also including elements mentioned above. Better than most but only just.Example Changing up the formula a little with this one. The downtempo nature brings something different to the table and its minimalism actually contributes to its overall feel. Definitely not the norm though.Example songs that could serve as an adequate standard for what I mean by Trap. Note that my argument is not that all sound the same but that the similar features are the defining features of Trap and that those features in themselves constitute poor music.'},\n {'id': 't3_2mczo6',\n  'titles': 'If a woman had worn this shirt nobody wouldve cared.',\n  'argument': 'A link to the story for those unawareNow I want to preface this by saying two things one I identify as a feminist as even a quick glance through my post history will attest and two Im not necessarily saying I think the damn thing was a good idea but I certainly dont think it was worth the todo thats going on.For those that dont wish to check out the link one of the Rosetta scientists wore a shirt with some sexy pseudopinup style women on it.

I am not implying that the karma system should be removed or changed in any way I am simply saying that the karma system is the reason behind this.

The karma system allows one group to impose their beliefs on another with a whose side has more people who believe in this kind of numbers game. It always comes down to the fact that if the hivemind does not completely agree with your opinion your post will simply be buried deep within the bellows of the website and very little discussion will ever be had about it. Every Redditor knows that saying things that are generally unpopular with the majority of Reddit can mean an infinite amount of karma loss and possible continuous harassment. For example I remember a while back I do not have a link sorry. of a Redditor who posted something negative about Jennifer Lawrence. He made a meme soon after explaining something about it and then I eventually seen a Bad Luck Brian meme about him several days later because every comment he ever made or close to was downvoted into oblivion and he was harassed nonstop. His having a different opinion than the hivemind pretty much destroyed his account. Something very similar happened to me once before as well when I was new to the website. I posted what is generally a very unpopular opinion on Reddit before I was aware that it was because it is my personal belief. The topic was the legalization of marijuana for recreational uses and I was hoping for some discussion about it because I had asked a question to another Redditor as to why he felt the way he did towards it being legalized something I am personally against. I asked why he was prolegalization stated one reason I am against it and told him that his story had made my day. I did not attack his opinion I did not downvote him I upvoted him in fact because I enjoyed the story he wrote and I had no ill intentions whatsoever. Instead of some sort of civil discussion and my question being answered what I got was overly defensive comments not from him he did not reply calling me an idiot just for having that opinion downvotes that never seemed to end on that comment until I deleted it being attacked for every little thing related or otherwise and no real discussion to be had. I was practically forced to delete that comment because of the nonstop harassment if I wanted to continue using my account. My comment also was not to just incite an argument seeing as how there was others saying how it should just be legalized in the other comments already and this was not a marijuana related subreddit I.E rtrees. It was raskreddit and the topic of legalization had already been present before I had posted that I was against it.Reddit is supposed to be a discussion board and website where people share their opinions something nobody should be harassed for. Harassment of those with controversial opinions continues and is something I regularly see being mentioned on subreddits like roffmychest. If so few are willing to truly have a discussion and instantly take to this numbers game then what point is there in even posting your opinion if its not what the collective wants to see?

At the moment the year is split up into twelve chunks but theyre not quite equal their lengths appear to have no logical order aside from summing to or and one of them has a different length every years. Whenever we refer to the frequency of an event as say once a month we could just as easily say that its once every days.Clarification Im saying that as it is once a month is very imprecise anyway since months have varying lengths.

He was born male and his sex change was the result of a botched circumcision. He then suffered bizarre forms of socalled therapy that included a doctor forcing him and his twin brother to rehearse sexual acts. We can all agree this whole situation is fucked up and should serve as a lesson for all medical professionals. But I dont see why that implies sex reassignment surgery on children is inherently evil.Unlike Reimer this child was not born with a single sex and then reassigned to a different one. He also wasnt forced into traumatic pseudoscientific behavioral therapy. From what I read it sounds like he was raised like any normal girl would be. I think the comparisons to Reimer are an example of the Reddit hivemind desperately seeking comparisons for what they perceive to be medical malpractice.Im certainly open to being convinced Reimers case is relevant but its not the important part of my view.As stated in the title I dont see anything wrong with what the doctors in this case did. The child was born with both sets of genitals and they made the decision he should be a girl. Lets look at some alternative scenarios.First if the child identified as female we would not be discussing it. I suspect this type of surgery happens quite often and the child grows up like any other member of their assigned gender. Its functionally the same as if they had been born that way.If the intersex child hadnt received surgery he would have grown up with ambiguous genitalia. Then he could have decided at a later time to be male female or whatever along with the corresponding surgery or lack thereof. This is what all the commenters say should have happened and its what I disagree with.I can only speculate on what that life would be like so if you have experienced this personally you can probably change my view quite easily but it sounds pretty terrible to me. Growing up is hard enough especially dealing with body and gender issues. Im not saying you should be embarrassed to be intersex but that doesnt mean I wouldnt have been embarrassed about it if I were years old and my genitals didnt look like anyone elses. And much as I think our societys gender roles are too rigid and need to be loosened it doesnt change the fact that identifying with a particular gender makes puberty much easier.Worst of all I cant imagine having both sets of genitals and identifying as a specific gender. That leaves you with the choice of getting major surgery as an adult as a guy the thought of getting my dick cut off even for such an important part of my life sounds horrific or being stuck in a body you dont feel comfortable in.Note that in the case in question the child doesnt identify as intersex he identifies as male. If he had both sets of genitals he would currently be as unhappy as he is with just a vagina. The only difference is apparently FTM surgery is much harder than MTF but that just tells me the doctors should have made him a male at birth so he had the option to become female later rather than leaving him intersex.Therefore if I was born intersex I would rather have gender reassignment surgery ASAP. If doctors make the right choice great. If they make the wrong choice Im no different from any other trans person.By the way Im not saying intersex infants should have to receive surgery. If the parents want to raise their child intersex I guess thats their choice just like theyre free to raise a child with a penis as a girl.

Try as I might I just cant see how at least the first part of the statement could be false. I present this in the true spirit of I feel like I might be missing something.My particular view is that in a number of Disney movies the heroes skins are Caucasian and the villains skins are shades of dark brown purple grey and that this creates an association between evil and dark skin that children pick up very easily. There are plenty of Disney movies where this is not the case but there are enough that it is an issue Aladdin Lion King Little Mermaid Mulan Hercules probably more.Beyond this obvservation there are a variety of arguments that many Disney movies are racist An article from the Guardian detailing the history mainly from a stereotype voice actors race angle. A listicle with plenty of video links some back to the s amp s. Is there anyone that will argue that even these are not harmfully racist? And if they are harmfully racist at which point did the racism disappear or become benign? Diversity in Disney Films a collection of Essays. Several more books on Amazon.So where are the well reasoned arguments that these depictions are not racist? I think there is some fundamental disagreement between my friend and I on the way meaning is created and thus how media works. For her the darkness evoking evil stops there it is only incidental that skin is being used as the pallet. She goes on to joke about blue people being offended by Genie etc... Further she believes that the model is just too simple. That the mechanisms of racism are much more complicated than this belief allows and that it is this kind of thinking that leads to rampant Political Correctness. This is possibly why I am most interested in this argument. I find many arguments that lead to rampant PC to be compelling but I certainly detest the world in which we are all policing each other for racial feminist etc.. correctness.For me it naturally follows that if these characters are teaching negative stereotypes about race then they are harmful to children as they learn about the world. If you agree that the movies are racist but that they dont have that big of an impact on children Id be interested in those arguments as well.Finally Im much more interested in scholarly or at least wellstudied arguments than how you personally feel about the subject without deep consideration.

I believe it was on of the biggest shocks to my personal views on the world. All my life I suffered from lack of sexualsocial success I wasnt confident I didnt know how to deal with people around me and I basically reverted to being a nice guy which is something people amp popculture advocates through advice movies selective presentation by the media and so forth. When I was introduced to the PUA community years ago and eventually TRP a few months ago it was the first time in my life I was given helpful advice on how to become someone who can actually make it in todays society in terms of being socialsexual. Those communities taught me about confidence staying true to myselfself embracing my sexuality and most of all become the best version of myself and aim for the stars in a way that is actually applicable to the real world and not in the form of some cliched advice that people oblivious to those concepts could possibly grasp and implement.I do agree with a lot of statements regarding TRP making generalizations about women to a point of dehumanizing them. But on the other hand there is no other community that gives you genuine advice on how to become that successful person you always wanted to be and reach your goals in life and I sincerely believe that someone who will ignore the MRAoriented side of TRP and focus on the advice they give on selfimprovement as proven mostly true by peoples Field Reports will prosper beyond his imagination and theres no competition in that field. The world is a harsh place full of mostly egocentric people that will not reach out for people with that kind of weaknesses and one must seek it out in places like TRP to have a chance of actually bettering theirselves.The reason I believe that is by looking at facts Before being exposed to the PUA community and TRP I had no courage to even talk to a girl I had interest in was socially awkward and was made fun of most of my teenage years. This applies to a lot of men my age who you could see for a fact that didnt even know how to deal with those kind of issues and suddenly its like they swallowed a magic pill.After Learned to take the initiative and lead the interaction as directly suggested by those communities take responsibility for sexual escalation which doing only halfassed while not being experienced always turned girls off and finally lost my virginity.

And while I dont necessarily think that women in these cases should not be punished at all I think punishing them as much as older men who prey on young girls is also not appropriate.I dont think its a controversial statement to say that males are naturally more sexually aggressive and promiscuous than females. That is seen across cultures and even across species. Simply put men want sex more than women they just do. Sure or year old boys may not have the mental andor emotional capability to fully consent to sex but pretending that boys at that age dont want sex is completely disingenuous and so is pretending that girls by and large are as driven by sexual motives as boys.

Were just in there to use the bathroom. If youre using a stall theres no way to tell the gender of another person anyway so whats it matter if theyre standing or sitting? And if a guys using a urinal whats it matter? His back is to you you cant see anything. In places with unequal numbers of men and women like an office separating can lead to one bathroom being overfull while the other has perfectly usable stalls that people dont use because theyre not the right gender. As transqueer gendered people are coming out and becoming more accepted distinguishing between two genders for the bathroom just reinforces a gender binary that could potentially alienate them. There are already unisex and family bathrooms some places that are used with no complaint. That whole separate but equal problem probably fits in here somewhere.I understand and accept that places susceptible to potential harassment should probably segregate the bathrooms bars clubs locker rooms possibly high schools but for restaurants and lots of businesses it seems kind of silly to me.So convince me otherwise.'},\n {'id': 't3_2ljn6y',\n  'titles': 'The private sector can do anything that the public sector can do but with more efficiency.',\n  'argument': 'First off I want this to be USAspecific simply because it is the only government I have lived under maybe if there is some really good counterpoint with another nation I would hear it but I am mainly looking for answers related to the US government.

I know that the real purpose of a government is to protect certain values that a society believes are rights of the citizens it is the governments job to ensure that the food is safe or that some random business allows for equal opportunity I understand that. Heres my general point. There is not a single example of a government organization working with greater efficiency than a corporate or privatesector competitor. This could be post officeUPS the post office in USA loses tons of money has too many stores etc. public works for cities VS independent saltingroad repair companies or even the entirety of the US military VS Blackwater Blackwater never had a single failed mission in Iraq.

And to juxtapose their inefficiency there are corporations working in the exact same sectors making lots of money USPS vs UPS.Here is a good example of what I think would better serve the nation. Instead of having the TSA at every airport harassing your grandmother because their inept ability to identify why shouldnt the government just publish a certain set of standards that need to be met by each airport security checkpoint then each airport hires a private security firm?

I work moderately hard always take my job seriously and deliver the required results.But I also take pride in achieving as much as possible with as little effort as possible. I am always searching for opportunities to automate tedious and repetitive parts of my job and I try to completely avoid taking on projects that have a low return compared to their workload.Out of principle I never work more longer than a hour week unless its a real emergency.So far Ive done OK. Im an engineer and most of my jobs are year contracts for large corporations. Im not high up the corporate ladder but the salary is high enough to cover all my material needs plus save about for retirement. I know that if I worked a lot harder I would have the chance to be promoted to a director position but I dont see the point. The net wage would be higher but I would have to sacrifice more than of my timeampenergy for the corporation. Also in my field director positions seem less safe than manager positions. Directors cost more and are the first people to be laid off when there is a restructuring. I cannot take my achievements to the grave. To me life is not about achievements but about experiences. Achievements are just a means to an end which is having awesome experiences. There is a case to be made that social status itself is an experience worth pursuing but corporate titles dont really impress the people closest to me. They only impress people I dont like and dont care about. There certainly are situations where hard work is worth it but working for a corporation is not one of them. Most of the fruits of your labor will go to the shareholders and not to your salary. For an employee the returns diminish very sharply in the corporate word.

In order to combat this problem each side in a legal battle should be forced to contribute equal money to their own counsel and their opponents counsel.',\n  'argument': 'There are two parts to this view and I will award deltas if you can change either of them. The first is that money in courts is a fundamental miscarriage of justice. When I see cases where a drunk kid kills people but their rich parents get them off with their crack team of lawyers or a powerful corporation destroys a regular person or small business with a costly court case on extremely weak grounds because the small business cant afford to fight back I am sickened. Equality in the eyes of the law is in my opinion the single most important part of our society and in the current system the rich and the poor are not equal in the eyes of the law.The second part of my view is that a good solution to this problem is to require that both sides in a lawsuit or court case contribute equally to their own legal team and their opponents. Ive thought long and hard about this and this is the best thing I can come up with. Other attempts to bring equality to courts that Ive seen all fall short somewhere. The loser paying the winners legal fees doesnt help because it only takes place after the end of the lawsuit and large corporations win by dragging on a suit until the small business runs out of money and has to give up. Preventing money from entering the courts in the first place doesnt work because some issues actually are complex and nuanced and require lots of lawyers time to analyse. Having each party contribute equally to their own and their opponents legal fees ensures that complex cases can be sorted out as long as one party is willing to pay for it it ensures that both sides are equal in the eyes of the law and it solves the problems I brought up earlier. In the case of he rich parents paying to get their drunkdriving son off easy they would be forced to contribute an equal amount to the states case allowing the state to effectively fight back and it prevents large corporations bleeding small entities dry because the small entities arent using their own money anymore.Essentially the legal system has in some cases been turned into a weapon and this proposal would turn it back into what it should be a way to determine wrongdoing.One note Dont try to change my view that this cant be done because it is a restriction on freedom without first trying to convince me that freedom is more important than equality.

We need to accept two things universal vegetarianism isnt going to happen soon and if it happens in the future it will probably be due to good quality lab meet or some other fundamental changes in society. Second an individual not eating meat makes zero difference almost. Unless you live on a farm or directly hunt your meat not a single animal is saved. By the time you reject a burger your rejection pretty much only affects you. However that doesnt mean there is no reason to be a vegetarian or to care. One reason is if you are personally so disturbed by knowing what you are eating that you genuinely dont want meat. That is great but we can agree that is a personal reason that might help better you as an individual but wont help the world. Only remaining reason would be contributing to a trend. If restaurants keep getting vegetarian requests they might actually start ordering less meat and that will culminate and the difference might be felt. However it is more likely that while they will develop a better vegetatarian offer the need for meat will only keep increasing with the growing number of population and contributing to the trend of not eating meat at all wont do any difference. However there is a different trend that many meat eaters are getting behind as well and that is caring about where your meat is from and whether the animals were ethically treated. Many people arent able to give up meat but they do care about animals. If you go behind this trend you might contribute to making a difference. A restaurant that would otherwise just leave their meat as it is and make a vegetarian option after hearing enough people ask about where the meat is from might totally change their meat suppliers. That is a big difference. The trend would push farms to be more humane if selling otherwise becomes difficult. For a local place being the fifth regular who cares about this could even be enough to make a difference. It just seems like the next realistic goal is getting behind demanding better treatment for animals and that can be achieved if the intended consumers of the meat make these demands. As a vegetarian you are not the consumer and therefore you are not of interest to them. You are really only doing it for yourself and not fighting for anything achiavable.

If someone were to talk to me I assume they would classify me as an atheist as I do not think that there is a continuation of any sort after death. Some say that life is important and life matters BECAUSE it ends which is a beautiful thought in my head however I cant get behind it because nothing is permanent. For example why does it matter whether someone acts justly and is a good person versus acting vile and offensive? Im not saying that we should all be dicks to each other but what I am saying is that in the long run there will be no evidence of someone acting either way. Most people will be completely forgotten within years of their death. I used to believe that I should strive to be one of the lucky few who should rise above and do something so great that they are remembered indefinitely. Nowadays I realize that this was a stupid thought because on a long enough timeline everything that everyone has ever done will be lost. When the sun explodes or even if some of us survive that when some sort of cosmic event destroys every part of the universe we are a part of. OR even simply when the human race becomes extinct or if we evolve when all of the branches of the tree that came from us falls to extinction. After that I felt that helping people mattered because even if I couldnt be remembered I could still have an effect on peoples lives in a positive manner and that has to count for something however if everyone who you helped is one day going to be long gone and every inkling of evidence that you or anyone you ever came into contact with even existed will be gone from the universe then what is the point? How does anything matter?That being said I recognize that if nothing matters than perhaps because of that fact maybe just maybe everything is important. Perhaps every single blade of grass moment in time leaf in the wind is infact important. This is the point of view that I would like to adopt but right now it seems that it takes too much faith and not enough logic for me to take the step into this mindset. If anyone has this mindset or has someway for me to rationalize this view please feel free to comment.Lastly I would like to keep this thread on topic.

And I recognize that human activity appears to be the main driver of it. But I dont think the consequences will be as dire as are portrayed for humanity. In the following most of my source material is going to come from the IPCC which is I think a fairly good source for data on this and if anything has an institutional bias in the direction of warning of dire consequences.There are fourthree avenues that I think are of primary concern Sea level rise. The IPCC estimates a sea level rise in the range of .m over the next century. While thats not trivial its also not dire. Most coastal communities can manage that level of rise with levees and sea walls. Occasionally someone shows a map with a city like New York or Miami under a or meter rise in sea levels but the IPCC estimates give that a very low probability of happening. Drought and other negative impacts on agricultural production. I do not deny that some areas will see reduced rainfall but I dont think that can be true for everywhere indeed it would seem like higher aggregate temperatures would result in more atmospheric water vapor and more aggregate rainfall. So while some areas may be negatively impacted others will be positively impacted. Further weve been getting progressively more efficient agriculturally as time goes on. Across the world the amount of agricultural land per capita has been falling for decades and in developed nations where population growth is slow is falling in absolute terms. See pg. in this IPCC report This other report on the impact of climate change on crop output says with whats described as medium confidence that Severe weather events. While I dont deny that global warming can cause more severe weather events such as hurricanes I question whether this is a very dire consequence. As our weather forecasting improves and our disaster preparedness improves the loss of life from weather events falls. Even a very bad storm like Katrina was not nearly as devastating to human life as a storm with no warning years before. Further the IPCC expresses low confidence page of that source that the number of tropical cyclones is measurably impacted by climate change. Its a plausible hypothesis but not one that seems to have been proven yet.So the reason I am looking to see my view possibly changed on this is that I often see people proposing dire consequences and accordingly drastic action of the type that will massively impact standards of living especially among people in developing nations where energy is an enormous part of peoples daily budgets. I dont see the consequences of warming as being severe enough to justify those drastic measures and would like to know if theres something Im missing. Also Im primarily concerned with the impact on humans. While certainly we have to live in the natural environment and so it matters that the environment is in decent shape I see it as more an instrumentality to human wellbeing not an end in itself.For a bit of background Im not a climate scientist and dont have any particular area of expertise in this though I do have a fairly high base level of scientific knowledge and am open to fairly technical rebuttals.'},\n {'id': 't3_2l3xj1',\n  'titles': 'I think marijuanas lack of obvious negative sideeffects makes it a more harmful drug.',\n  'argument': 'Compared to most recreational drugs marijuana has very few apparent negative side effects. Its come down basically makes the user sleepy compared to nauseaheadache with alcohol or mood swings with substances like cocaine or mdma. You are fairly functional while high on marijuana and the drug is relatively cheap.The lack of negative side effects makes it easy for moderate users to become everyday users. Everyday users are more likely on average to lose motivation and become content with short term stimulus compared to achieving longterm goals. Heavy use also tends to lead to a certain amount of dependency where the user has difficulty quitting even if they decide they want to. Where im from Canada I see everyday weed smokers for every single alcoholic. I cant help but imagine many of them would be happier had they never smoked weedonly smoked weed moderately. I see alcohol and other drugs as more obviously dangerous and therefore people tend to treat them more carefully or ignore them all together less likely to drink and drive than smoke and drive.I believe that if weed had an unpleasant come down less people would become heavyusers and they would ultimately be happier for it.

Here are my two exceptions where I feel it is the fault of the dooropener. When the driver or passengers leave the vehicle when it is not in a proper parking spot. This is an illegal time to open the door anyway. Ive seen videos taken in New York of Taxi passengers being like this is the best spot to get out even though my Taxi is still in the middle of the road and then BAM. Door prize. This is the passengers fault.. When the driver opens the door into a marked bike lane without ensuring it is safe to do so. Note if the bike lane is positioned correctly it should never be within the door range of a parked car anyway so this situation should never exist but in reality it sometimes does exist. In the situations where it does exist I think that since the driver had to safely cross a marked bike lane to park their car it should be incredibly obvious that they need to be careful when opening their door on the way out. Thats why in this situation I think its the fault of the dooropener.Now on to my arguement. First off I do cycle on the road in a decent size city from time to time I used to do it full time so I am sympathetic to the plights of cyclists. Im not just an ignorant driver yelling from my spot of comfort.When I do ride I feel like I ride in a very safe patient predictable fashion. For example I dont pass by cars stopped at intersections because I dont feel that it is reasonable for them to be expected to see me. Ill sit directly behind them in line with their license plate and Ill let them do what they are doing without me making an erratic sudden unexpected pass. If I cant get directly behind them Ill still let them turn right or left or whatever without darting in front of them or near them. Cars have many blind spots and motorists cant be reasonably expected to check all of them all the time as well as monitor whats in front of them while making a turn. Not even the best mostattentive driver in the world could do so. Therefore I ride the way I do not only to keep myself safe but to make life easier and less stressful on motorists. Were all in this together.Doorprizing is probably the best example of cyclists having an attitude like People have to watch out for me in blank situation! Im not at all going to help them not make a mistake in blank situation just because Im not legally required to do so even though I could make the same mistake if I was them.. I understand how in the law it is written that a motorist must always open their door only when it is safe to do so. However I do not agree with this law as I do not feel that is it reasonable to blame a driver for opening his or her door into the path of a cyclist. Heres why. Even the best most attentive driver can miss a cyclist that is riding close enough to be doorprized. You can shoulder check mirror check or whatever. If a cyclist is within only a few feet of that side of your car and coming fast then they can be difficult to see until its too late. This is especially true if they are riding parallel with your driver side tires when you are making your checks and then they suddenly turn out to go around you when you go to open the door.. Pedestrians are expected to cross at crosswalks. Why? Because a driver cant be expected to monitor for pedestrians that are crossing at every part of the road from every direction so we put the crosswalks at certain parts of the roads so that the drivers know where to expect pedestrians. Similarly its just as reasonable to say cyclists it is illegal for you to ride in the range of the doors because its not reasonable for drivers to expect you to be on simply any part of the road you want. You have to be where they expect traffic. They dont expect traffic right next to them when they are parked.. The cyclist for their own safety should not be riding in range of the doors. They are doing something incredibly dangerous by riding in the door range of parked cars. If someone is doing something incredibly dangerous and someone hurts them as a result then often the person who hurts them should not be held at fault. I feel this is one of those situations.. Doorprizing a cyclist is a mistake anyone can easily make and its much easier to teach the cyclist not to ride in the doorprize lane than it is to teach the driver to ensure that every single time they open their door they need to spend the to seconds to do their best to make sure no cyclist is about to dangerously pass them even if the driver is preoccupied in a rush distracted by a child wanting to get out of the car etc.. Keep in mind youre not just teaching drivers youd have to teach children too because anyone can be opening one of the doors on that side of the car. Also I think youd be dishonest with me if you say that every single time you open your car door you are aware of whats next to you. Youre lucky that there was never an irresponsible cyclist those times that you did.Finally a cyclist might argue sometimes I need to cycle in the doorprize lane because theres not enough room for cars to pass me if I ride further to the left. In that situation you should simply take the lane which means that you ride in the centre of the lane so cars cannot pass you. This is legal you are still riding as far to the right as is safe to do so. If there are cars parked along the side of the road then the traffic on that road is likely slow enough that you will have little trouble taking the lane. If cars need to pass and youd prefer to not have them sit behind you you can move over into the doorprize lane and stop and wait until its reasonable to move into the regular traffic lane again. The hazard of riding near parked cars is incredibly obvious to the cyclist but the hazard of opening the car door is not so obvious to the dooropener because of human nature and what we are taught. The cyclist has more control over where heshe rides than we have control over our occasional forgetfulness or ignorance especially while doing something as innocent to our brain as opening a door no matter how hard we try or how responsible and cautious of a person we are. The cyclist is knowingly and deliberately doing something that is wellunderstood to be quite dangerous when there are alternatives even if you are forced into the doorlane you can always ride slowly there or even come to a stop if thats what it takes to ride safely while the dooropener is unknowingly and accidentally doing something dangerously that . of the time is safe and harmless.'},\n {'id': 't3_2kose9',\n  'titles': 'The Government should neither regulate marriage All aspects of a Marriage should be determined by the individuals being Married and grounded in Civil Contracts',\n  'argument': 'The title says it all. My nation the United States has a long history of controversy in regards to marriage. Up until interracial marriage was illegal in many states. Today I suspect most of the public supports the legality of interracial marriage. Since Plural marriages known mostly for the practices association with the Mormon church has been illegal. Then of course in recent years theres been the controversy over gay marriage George W. Bush putting opposition into law and over course his successor Barack Obama pushing in the opposite direction. Personally I just dont see why these issues are any business of the government. During the debate over gay marriage the slippery slope argument was often cited that if you legalize gay marriage next thing you know women will be wanting to marry a zebra or something. Personally I say if the Zebra can sign the documents and take the vows who am I to stand in the way of love? Frankly I dont see it as my business.The issue of plural marriage is more controversial its been associated with abuse forced marriage sexual assault of minors. But to my mind it would be more sensible to pass laws against abuse forced marriage and sexual assault than to ban plural marriage which does not inherently include any of this. My opinion is this I see no advantage and significant disadvantage to Government regulation of marriage. The marriage contract at its heart is just a civil contract that comes with tax incentives and a few other incentives such as inheritance rights and the ability to visit loved ones in the hospital. This contract should be governed by the people who want to enter into it and subject to no more or less restriction and oversight than other contracts.

Youve crossed the void and theres no going back your life is your childs and no longer your own.This is why parents can deal with babys crying and pooping and general nastiness because you are evolutionarily primed to love your child that much.

Not having child is objectively a great decision economically timewise etc. However you miss out on what a significant part of the human experience. Moreover it is much easier to fall into a life that feels purposeless without a child as an easy answer.When I weigh the two together I cant help but come to the conclusion that having a child getting high off of parenthood and creating conscious and needy life is more selfish than using the resources you would use on the child to better the world. I am making the assumption that instead of childbearing the wouldbe parent involves him or herself in some sort of meaningful charity work. I also want to be clear that Im not saying that having a child makes you a selfish person or even that having a child is necessarily selfish in and of itself.

However I believe these are offset and outnumbered by the tyranny and atrocities committed under nondemocratic governments.When I say this I mean that I believe comparing modern and past democracies to modern and past dictatorships and monarchies throughout history will yield the conclusion that the quality of life in a democracy is substantially better for most people and that as more people are given franchise the better and better it gets. Conversely if for example the U.S. had been a oneparty dictatorship for the past years atrocities such as chattel slavery genocide of indigenous peoples and unwarranted global intervention would be that much worse if imagining such is even possible.I want to clarify that I am using the U.S. as my main example because thats where I am also I think it is a good example of a particularly controversial example of democracy.I believe that one of the biggest problems with American democracy to date is the ambivelence people have towards democracy. Judging even just from the posts on this sub many are incredibly disappointed with democracy and will even go as far as to say it is obsolete or just a bad idea in the first place. When we stop having faith in democracy we stop having faith in the people and ourselves and necessarily cede our power to others. Change my view!Ok there have been a lot of requests for me to pin things down better and define my view Id say it has changed a little since I first posted but here it isDemocracy is any form of government concerned with the idea of giving more people say more people equality more people freedom. So for example the U.S. falls short of these things in many ways and at many times but at least it is founded on the premise of expanding the categories that receive citizenship.At the founding of the U.S. citizenship was incredibly limited but it was still a far larger category of participants than european monarchy.So Democracy is dynamic and you can have moments in the same systemgovernmentculture that are democratic and undemocratic.

Even operating at your absolute peak imagination you ran out of original ideas for shit to do about lets be generous here years after you arrived at the gates. That was and a half billion years ago. Youre really bored of your own mind now. Remember the Bible promised you that YOU that is a semblance of the limited being that lived on earth and earned its way to heaven would get to Heaven so even in your Heavenly form you must also be in some way limited. You get to share in the ideas of lots of other people too though. Lets be SUPER generous here and pretend that even though youre all Christians and therefore at least to some degree think in similar ways each individual person has another years worth of original material in their minds.

The closest you can get to the comfort of nothingness of death is to float in an empty space eyes closed thinking of nothing.

Help me sort this out would ya?Animals do not know any better so they cannot be blamed for their actions i.e. hunting and eating other animalsI would think one of the premises for the existence of rehabilitation efforts in prisons for people who once felt it was okay to injure or kill other human beings is that criminals can effectively be taught to know better. Therefore a person who believes eating meat is immoral should feel that the same rehabilitative efforts should be made for animals who hunt other animals. As they are it is natural for them to hunt. However it is also natural for murderers to murder when they commit their murders. We need to change what is natural for them reform the animals so that they no longer feel the need to prey upon others.Of course aside from the fact that this sounds a bit silly I believe it is impossible to do. This would therefore lead a person who believes eating meat is immoral to the conclusion that predatory animals need to be put down the same way that murderers who we deem cannot be rehabilitated would be issued a death sentence. Perhaps locking up carnivorousomnivorous animals for lifeterm sentences could also suffice? In any case it would seem that severe and immediate action needs to be taken.The only way I feel you can get around this is to find a successful way of reverting wild animals intrinsic tendencies to hunt others. But again I do not feel like this is a realistic possibility.Maybe I am just a bit tired or out of it but I am strangely and surprisingly convinced by this line of reasoning.

Animals who hunt other animals take the lives of other sentient beings without their consent. Therefore Person A believes that these predatory animals are doing something wrong.

To change my view you will need to either convince me that there is a significant fundamental difference between the two or that its ok to kill dogs for fun. As someone who really enjoys eating meat I would really like for my view to be changed. I have spoken with a few people about this in the hopes that they would convince me that its ok to continue eating meat but so far the arguments have been entirely unconvincing.Id like to preemptively address some arguments that I do not find compelling.. People need to eat to survive therefore eating meat is morally acceptable.I do not find this answer compelling because we do not have to eat meat to survive. We can live perfectly healthy lives without eating any meat. Eating meat is certainly enjoyable to many people but that is hardly a justification. Some people enjoy killing dogs and I dont consider that an acceptable justification.. Eating meat is natural. We have been doing it since we were cavemen.Raping people is also natural and we have also been doing it since we were cavemen.. We have domesticated some animals to the point where they cannot survive in nature. If we were to not raise them for consumption they would go extinct.I am not sure that I am really opposed to the extinction of species that cannot survive in nature but if I were I suppose we could make a small nature preserve where cows pigs and chickens live. If you are going to complain about the cost rest assured that the cost would be far outweighed by our consumption of more efficient food.. If the animals are raised in a humane way and slaughtered painlessly and without causing them any fear whats the problem?Im not sure why I feel like it is wrong. But I do know that if someone liked to adopt puppies treat them humanely and then execute them in a painless manner just for fun it seems morally reprehensible to me. Maybe someone can explain why I feel this way or convince me that its ok.. Killing dogs for fun is ok because they dont have a soul or arent selfaware or something like that.I dont think there is anything fundamentally different about a dog and a human that would make it ok to kill one and not the other without a pretty good reason.. What about fish? What about eggs? What about spinach? Its alive too. You have to draw the line somewhere.Thats true. Im not sure where the line should be but I do know that pigs are as smart and adorable as dogs so I dont see why any rules of morality should extend to one and not the other.. Animals kill other animals for food. Is that immoral?Many animals do not have a choice but to eat meat. In those cases it is not immoral for them to kill for food. In the cases of animals that are perfectly capable of subsisting without killing I would say that they are behaving in an immoral way but I dont blame them since they probably lack the reasoning capacity to think about this situation from the other creatures point of view.'},\n {'id': 't3_2k08pw',\n  'titles': 'The United States and other world governments should create sterilization incentive programs.',\n  'argument': 'What I mean specifically is that governments experiencing problems relating to high and growing populations should offer one time payments to any fertile individual who volunteers for sterilization.

I dont have any figures on how much is spent on this but I suspect it is not cheap. Even if it was only slightly more expensive or even the same cost as an inmate with no religious obligations it is an inconvenience for the prison staff but that is only a minor issue. My biggest issue is that people in prison are there because they did something illegal and they have a debt to pay to society. We should keep them alive and in no worse health than when they went in but we shouldnt be concerned about keeping them overly comfortable. It is supposed to make you uncomfortable as a deterrent to doing another crime.I wont be convinced by any argument that ignoring their religious obligations amounts to cruel and unusual punishment. If lighting came from the sky and struck them for eating bacon or taking off their headgear then I might agree but the fact is that no harm has ever come to a person from ignoring their religious obligations.

Many times my legs end up pressed right up against the seat in front of me. This is uncomfortable for me as it often hurts forces me to arrange my legs in strange ways to actually be able to sit comfortably and often even prevents me from lowering the tray table fully. It is also uncomfortable for other people as the person in front of me usually cannot recline their seat and has to deal with my knees in their back and the persons next to me often have to put up with my feet in their footwell as they cannot fit anywhere else. It can also be dangerous if I am wedged in a seat as I often am I am less able to move freely in case of evacuation and could also block other people in my row.My height is not a disability nor an abnormality. I am able to lead a completely normal life and have no difficulties or hindrances in almost any other walk of life. It is also something I have absolutely no control over and something that cannot be changed. As such it is my view that where available on airliners I should be able to access seats with extra legroom at no extra cost.In many airlines it is the case that one can purchase seats with extra legroom and no other change or increase in service. In these cases I think tall people should be offered these seats without having to pay the extra charge. Of course tall people can waive their right to these seats if they want to make sure they sit next to their travelling companions but the offer should be made. I dont mind how airlines decide how to implement this whether by visual inspection when you check in requiring you to be measured I wouldnt mind having my height measured to be able to fly in minimum comfort when allocating seats or any other method. However I think that the desires of those who pay for extra leg room should not outweigh the need of tall people to fit in their seat and that as long as someone is over a certain height which the airline could determine based on their knowledge of their seating arrangements they should be offered a chance to sit somewhere with enough space for them without any extra cost.At the very least I think emergency and even bulkhead row seats should not be sold at an extra premium and should be reserved for tall people. If there are no tall by the airlines definition passengers then they could be allocated to anyone who is lucky enough. If an airline wishes to make profit of extra leg room seats they should install seats with extra leg room and should no be allowed to make their profit at the expense of people who literally cannot help how tall they are. !'},\n {'id': 't3_2jug85',\n  'titles': 'I should give little or no money to charity during my life and instead save it and leave it in my will',\n  'argument': 'Ive been thinking about personal finance recently and this is a conclusion that seemed reasonable.

Edgy people on the Internet spread the persons picture around as part of some ironic joke all the churches across the country hold daily prayer services or whatever. The whole country gets completely worked up and panicky and this is exactly what the shooter wants. The part that makes me the most angry is that a news station or magazine directly profits from publishing every single scrap of information they can get their hands on. Youll see pictures of the shooter from years before the event took place. These tragedies result in a profit for whatever news organization can deliver the most info to the grieving public perpetuating the state of panic for longer and fulfilling these sick murderers fantasies.

Almost all languages use the lefttoright writing convention so it is logical for the parenthesis to come first as it is the most critical component. Also a fallacious smiley face could be syntactically confusing if placed at the end of a sentence because it fuses with whatever punctuation that the sentence contains. The superior orientation does not share this downside.Most humans are right handed so they would naturally tilt their heads to the right. If looking at a mirror image of oneself and tilting their head to the right the smiley would naturally be oriented in the fashion. I know that some of you will invariably argue for the photographic version instead of the mirror image version but most people look at themselves in the mirror more often than in photos.On the keyboard itself it is much more natural to go from a higher key to a lower key rather than the other way around.

I am currently in high school marching band and have never been good at any actual sports.A sport has always been a competitive activity that involves either individuals or teams competing against each other to win a game or match. Sports have clear winners that can be determined by either the amount of points an individual or team wins ex football soccer tennis etc. or which individual or team finishes first ex swim track etc..Therefore anything that cannot be determined to have a clear winner should not be considered a sport. Even if you dont accept this definition there is a clear difference between artistic activities and athletic activities. Athletic events require mostly physical fitness and coordination and have a clear winner. Artistic events like marching band and dance may require physical activity but mostly utilize ones creative interpretation. Additionally artistic events cannot be judged objectively and artistic competitions almost always have judges who use their own subjection to determine the winners.Now for some reason there has been a strange push in the last decade or so to define just about any and all extracurricular activities as sports especially in high schools. When meeting someone in high school instead of asking what that person enjoys to do the primary question seems to be what sports do you play.

This naturally means that government is illegitimate if it tries to rule me in any way. If I need to formulate a natural rights theory in this thread I can. I am not interested in a utilitarian argument for or against government and society. That does not get to the question Am I subject to a social contract against my consent? I feel that any form of free rider problem is a utilitarian argument and I will evaluate it as such unless an argument is made why I shouldnt evaluate it in that way.I think the best way to approach this subject for me is to make the argument that SCT social contract theory is true and is not mutually exclusive with complete consent. That was the first plank or why I think SCT is false.The second plank is that SCT advocates have their own agendas to enforce their own worldview on society. I dont have a formulated argument for this because I think this is selfevident due to the fact that every SCT advocate has an affirmative worldview and think that society should be run in adherence with it. Change my view.. God created man. This doesnt have the be God of the Bible or even the God of a theistic religion. To my knowledge most western religions hold this to be true.. Because God is totally free so are humans. I want to qualify this. No one is free to harm another person. If people were free to harm other people then no one would be free. . Since these rights were given to people by God people can not take these rights away. People can surrender various rights as that is a right.Thats my approach. The implication is that I believe in the nonaggression principle. That is no one can initiate physical aggression against another or his property. It is legitimate to everything else.This is why Im not interested in utilitarianism I dont disbelieve in social contract for any consequentialist reason. Even if it is more practical for a society to be governed by social contract that would not change my view that such governance is a violation of the natural law.

It can be extremely difficult to deduce the truth for a suspect. Often times police officers lie to try and get the suspect to give up information or confess in hopes of lessening punishment or explaining their side of the story. My argument is that such lies also encourage the suspect to confess even if they didnt do it to try and lessen the punishment. It also fosters an attitude among the public of dont trust a cop because you know they can and will lie if they think itll help their case whether its true or not.In regard to exceptions Im okay with the police lying in two situations. First if they are currently undercover in an investigation. It is obviously impossible to conduct such investigations otherwise. Second I would say lying is okay if they have reason to suspect someones life is at risk such as if a kidnapper has someone tied up somewhere and you need to rescue them. !'},\n {'id': 't3_2j28la',\n  'titles': 'Having a military is just as socialist as having universal healthcare.',\n  'argument': 'In short if the US government is willing to spend billions of dollars on defense and millions of Americans support this defense spending why do many of the same people fight so adamantly against the government paying for healthcare?A lot of us dont agree with defense spending myself included.

Im not convinced that rape culture exists in a significant way and I certainly dont believe that society is cultured to excuse rapists. To clarify I believe that rape culture hardly exists not that it doesnt exist at all. First of all sexual assault is punished severely. These long prison sentences are accepted by both men and women and I rarely see anyone contesting these punishments. It seems that society as a whole shares a strong contempt for rapists. Also when people offer advice regarding ways to avoid rape the rapist is still held culpable. Let me use an analogy a person is on a bus and loses hisher phone to a pickpocket. People give the person advice on how to avoid being stolen from again. Does this mean that the thief is being excused or that the crime is being trivialized?Probably not. Ive noticed that often when people are robbed from or are victims of other crimes people tell them how they could have avoided it or how they could avoid a similar occurrence in the future. In fact when I lost my cell phone to a thief a few years ago my entire family nagged me about how I should have kept it in a better pocket. Of course rape are thievery are different. I completely acknowledge this. However wheres the line between helpful advice and rape culture?. I think that some feminists confuse these two placing both of them in the realm of rape culture. Personally I do not think that victims of any serious mentally traumatizing crime should be given a lecture on how they could have avoided their plight. This is distasteful especially after the fact even if it is well meaning.

In this sense patriarchy may be a natural tradition. This does not imply that patriarchy is good or justified though.The reason I think patriarchies outperformed matriarchies is that primitive societies were in no position to compensate for the potential distortions in judgement caused by the menstrual cycle of women. PMS in particular has unpredictable psychological consequences for women. On the average it seems likely that men would be more consistent decision makers than women.Although men do not have better judgement than women do on average a man of good judgement is more likely to be consistent than a woman of good judgement due to the psychological effects of the menstrual cycle on the woman.And to reiterate I am aiming at an explanation for patriarchy with reference to the efficient cause not at a justification for patriarchy. To clarify what I mean by primitive I mean primitive with special emphasis on the sophistication of the societys psychological science. Societies that can measure predict or otherwise compensate for the psychological effects of menstruation may not have any use for the nofemaleleaders heuristic. Therefore the advance of psychology as science has potentially made patriarchy obsolete. Im not understanding the reasoning behind men are stronger therefore patriarchy yet.

I still follow Ron Paul and his message has not changed whatsoever despite his assertion that leaving Iraq would be better for everyone.I think that the biggest mistake Ron Paul and libertarians in general made was assuming that leaving the middleeast would cause extremists to forgive us. The reason they hate us so much is not because we were over there but because we support Israel their number enemy. The libertarian answer to that is to simply stop funding and supporting Israel but I dont think that is a good idea especially on a moral level. People argue Israel is strong enough to defend itself but that is only because of all the military support we give them. Without us they would be overrun by the bordering Islamic nations that routinely vow to wipe them out.So we are basically stuck defending Israel which means we have to defend ourselves from attack. Simply leaving the area didnt stop extremists it only made them regroup and strengthen. Libertarians argue that its only moral to attack someone that attacks you first but when it comes down to it it would be better to fight them overseas rather than wait for them to come here.Libertarians also argue that we should not be the world police. I do sympathize with this point but we should also realize that if we were not doing it russia or china would take over the role and use invaded land as a military advantage. I used to believe that they were not interested in expanding land but Russias actions in Ukraine show otherwise and China is making economic strides for power that could turn into something more in the coming decades.

When both of those occur together you end up with a populace that hates and fears the police rather than trusting and respecting them. Police officers have a duty to combat and possibly prevent crime. It is literally a part of their titleon any given day police across the nation will directly encounter every aspect of any given societys criminal elements from petty speeding violators up through massmurderers. Thats their job. Any given encounter must be treated as a potential worst case scenario if the officer wants to maximize his chance at survival. Granted most encounters are NOT worst case scenarios but that only magnifies the fear for cops. Its like winning the asshole lotteryi.e. is today and in particular this one stop the day that you win the asshole lottery and have to use lethal force in order to survive? Is today the day that you could die because you didnt respond accordingly? Normal human beings have a survival instinct. Assuming that police officers are normal human beings they must also possess the same desire to protect their own lives when they make an arrest of any sort. Thus they will judge encounters based on prior policing knowledge in order to gauge threats and will react accordingly to protect their own lives.Now Im not arguing that police can and do abuse power. But I AM arguing that a combination of both media saturation and cultural misunderstandings skew public opinion away from police legitimacy and authority.

When Im in class at university and a fire alarm goes off which is usually a couple of times a semester no one takes it seriously. The professor finishes their last thought while everyone takes the time to neatly pack all of their stuff before exiting the building often using the main exit instead of the nearest emergency exit. Similarly at my dorm last year they would run unannounced fire drills as often as once a month it was so common and the odds of fire so low that generally people just assumed correctly that it wasnt real and sometimes didnt even leave their rooms. Back in high school there were fire drill quotas so if the school hadnt done any for a while they would end up having like three in one week although in fairness in high school the teacher and administration made sure everyone followed procedure so if there was a real fire it would not be a problem in this case but I still feel like it helps condition people to the fact that fire alarms are false alarms. Finally about a month ago I was at the mall and the fire alarm starts going off but no one reacted everyone just went about their business as usual.With these examples in mind it just doesnt seem like anyone takes fire alarms seriously and I think people following any of these practices during a real fire would be disastrous. I recognize that knowing what to do during a fire is crucial and acknowledge that occasional drills are necessary but I think that unannounced drills are counter productive. If drills were always known about ahead of time then at least people would know an unannounced drill was something to take seriously. Also I think that drills are way too common at least in schools and universities in other places they seem far less common in comparison to real fires to the point that a fire alarm in a large public place has a chance of being false.I also realize that in the event of a real fire not panicking and creating chaos is probably more important than reacting as quickly as humanly possible but I still feel like the opposite reaction is pretty bad too. The only way I see people treating a fire alarm seriously is if they can physically see fire but in that case I think all of the training against panicking will go out the window anyways. After all experience under nonlife threatening drill situations hardly emulate life or death situations.I realize that all of the examples I gave were anecdotal but it seems consistent enough over dozens of experiences that I think I can use them in an informal argument such as this.'},\n {'id': 't3_2iu5ia',\n  'titles': 'Some modern Libertarians hypocritically deny that Civil Rights are Rights',\n  'argument': 'I believe the modern Libertarian as defined by people like Ron Paul is hypocritical when they dont support the Civil Rights Act.

The right to a fair trialModern American liberals add a couple more rights ie from the UNs Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The right to an education. The right to life. The right to equal protection against discriminationMany Libertarians however deny that equal protection against discrimination should be a Right. The modern Libertarian doesnt believe in protected classes that you shouldnt be discriminated against for your sex race and religion in terms of business transactions. Libertarians publicly acknowledge that racism is a bad thing... yet go ahead and declare that anybody should be allowed to actively practice racism in business and in personal life. I think thats hypocrisy. If you believe something is bad you should outlaw it. I believe stealing is wrong... thats why everyone has a right to property ownership and a fair trial. Thats why the Right to Property exists to make the world a more fair place and to promote a good where people should profit from the fruits of their labor. The Right to Property and the Right to Equal Protection are very similar in many ways. Both demand a change in behavior of people. In nature you are allowed to thieve and steal however you want. The Right to Property protects people from thieves. The Right to Property restricts your freedom to take anything you want. In nature you are allowed to discriminate and be an asshole however you want. The Right to be protected from discrimination protects minorities from private persecution. It protects people from being hassled and from being denied services for no reason other than stupid ones such as the color of their skin. Many modern Libertarians dont stand up for Civil Rights because they dont have the moral integrity to stand up for what is Right. Thats why they deny everyone else common sense positive rights such as the right to life and thus access to things like healthcare the right to education etc. They dont have the integrity to say that these things are good things that should be promoted by society. They instead give some bullshit about how the State has no right to interfere with our lives even in positive ways! Yet at the same time they fully accept the States intervention on matters concerning property or their own privacy. Why do people get to enjoy the states protection in matters of property but suddenly when it comes to Civil Rights state protection is suddenly out of bounds????TLDR I believe when Libertarians say that freedom from discrimination is wonderful but its wrong to force people to behave a certain way! is a copout. Its hypocritical to deny a Right because it requires government coercion when all Rights require government coercion to enforce.

AfricanBritish is something thats unheard of and I feel that the common practice of labelling certain races as a part of a group of minorities in the US rather than labelling them by their nationality is in fact encouraging social inequality in a subtle way. When you refer to a large of people entirely based on their race and they themselves do as well it may not seem wrong. Particularly when they are given equal opportunities and equal rights as the rest of the population. However I argue that since their identity has been linked to their race nonetheless it in fact encourages an image of separation. When you introduce yourself you dont say Im a CaucasianAmerican. Yet it is normal for other races to introduce themselves as Im AfricanAmerican or Im AsianAmerican when we should all be saying Im American. Because then if all races are indistinguishable from each other and are known by their nationality then no subtle separation of identity happens and we can say we have realised equality on a small social scale as well as the large fundamental scale that weve achieved in recent decades.When I talk to a minority I dont identify the colour of their skin as an important thing to take notice of when I later explain him or her to a friend.

In recent weeks I questioned how I should be identifying myself. Am I ArmenianBritish? Am I really AryanBritish? Should I identify myself as just Armenian or British? Or Aryan? Or Half Armenian half British? Which side of my family is more relevant in determining how I see myself?Then I began asking myself how I would be perceived if I identified myself using any of the labels except British. Would I be seen as a foreigner? Would it still be equal for me to publicly identify myself something other than my nationality or mixing that with my designated race when someone describes me? If that were the case would people subtly view or judge me differently for it or think nothing of it? Does it depend on the person who learns this?

You dont have a condition but you are depressed. The difference is that you are depressed for a reason and that depression might be what you need to motivate yourself to fix your problems.

Though often pills are all the only thing a patient can afford as therapy is too expensive.The feelings of the patients are irrelevant as they are not doctors and they are biased.

Why risk screwing someone up worse when they actually can get over it themselves.TlDr The standards for prescribing antidepressants dont take into account whether the depression is chemical or circumstantial. Many of the arguments against stricter regulation are appeals to emotion not science. Now we have a lot of people on pills that just numb the pain of the real world which isnt much different than illicit drug abuse minus the high. However clinical depression does exist and some people do need antidepressants to function normally.

To give them a grade that is not reflective of what they actually understand at the end of the course is to defeat the purpose of the evaluation itself. Im using test broadly. I think things that are typically called projects are generally speaking a type of test. I dont think that repetitious busywork should ever be factored in to a grade. Also in case it matters Im speaking from the experience of someone who went through the American public education system.I understand that grades also can be used to measure certain personality factors conscientiousness ability to follow instruction adherence to procedural norms which all debatable might be as important as understanding the material. However you could simply give a separate evaluation of these factors instead rolling them all in to one. Its been observed that performance at the university level corresponds better to standardized test scores than to high school GPA so it is helpful to have a grade that isnt a vague amalgamation of different factors.

This does not make them sluts or whores or anything like that but it does distract the male teacher because it is in his nature to be this way.Now all the teacher can think about are these girls and cant keep his mind on the task at hand. The class suffers due to this and it is a loselose situation as the teacher cannot do his job. It is not necessarily the females fault here but it isnt completely the males fault either.If the schools require females and males although females have different triggers to wear decent clothing that smother at least part of this urge then no one suffers because of it.By having a strict dress code you eliminate the risk of having a situation between a male and female when the main goal is to educate not reproduce.Males are genetically wired to spread our seed as much as possible. Sure they are expected and required to control the execution of this urge when the other party is not interested but the mere fact that the urge exists is enough to distract them from their goals.Yes the school is taking away the freedom of students choice.

My issue here is that many people have tried to convince the world that no matter what size you are youre beautiful and should love your body. That being said this commercial shows one type of body rather curvy and maybe even verging on slightly overweight. Is real beauty not being thin even though you may happen to have a high metabolism or eat healthy foods? Is real beauty not being athletic or strong or muscular? Are we saying that its okay to have extra fat on your bodies because no matter what size you are youre beautiful? I realize that many people cant help what size they are no matter what they do and Im not saying that being stick thin or anorexic is okay either and I dont agree with modeling agencies that promote models being underweight.

Calling your parents mom or dad isnt just a sign of respect it is sign of love as well. Mom and Dad are titles that parents have earned by having and raising kids. Parenting is an extremely hard job and parents deserve respect. Another time I was very bothered by someone not calling their parents mom or dad is when my friend was talking about something nice her mom did and addressed her by her first name in the story. Regardless of the setting you should continue to call your parents mom and dad to show your ongoing respect for them whether youre out of the house or out with friends.I also believe that using Mr and Mrs when addressing those older than you or authority figures is an absolute must. I also know of people who prefer being addressed by just their first name because the title Mr or Mrs makes them feel old. They have insisted that even children as young as call them by their first name. Feeling old is fantastic in my opinion! It is also a natural part of life but it is also something that one should be proud of. It shows that you have lived and you are wiser than I am. It shows your level of knowledge is far beyond mine and that you deserve respect from me. Furthermore this also creates a problem later in life when children make calling adults and respected figures with higher statuses than them a habit. It is so disrespectful and hurts those who have earned these titles that demand respect.NOTE I am addressing the matter of people who prefer to have titles before their names and children who repeatedly forget to use the title or ignore the title altogether.

I only care about why they believe they are not staying home.Here is the core of my argument. Many women convince themselves that they really want to stay home with the kids but that their current financial realities over which they have no real control will not allow them to do so. Essentially they are convincing themselves that powers outside of their control are dictating that they must go back to work.I believe that for most families who use this line this is nonsense. There are usually options moving to a smaller houseapartment or a cheaper town cutting expenses going out to eat less cheaper vacations consigned clothes cordcutting etc.. Due to all kinds of cultural pressures of which so many of us are largely unaware many families legitimately feel like they cannot go without cable TV cook dinner for themselves each night go on cheaper vacations etc.I know that this post sounds incredibly judgmental.

I have noticed it is very hard for upper middle class students to find ways to fund college. Schools give out little grants to them and the government gives out even less. This however is justified in my opinion. There is only so much to give out. On the other hand I found private scholarships to be the most frustrating. Every single one that I applied for was based on financial need. My academic and philanthropic resume didnt matter. All that was looked at was how much my parents made. I am not suggesting that I should attend college for free. I shouldnt. However there should be more ways for middle class students to help aid them. Many times poorer students get money from the school and government and then from private scholarships.

Because of my parents pressure wanting me to succeed and obtain a successful job with high income so that they can retire early i have instilled a mindset that time is money. Unused time means lost of potential money.ProblemI started having this mindset near the middle of highschool. During that time I realize why am I wasting my time playing games? Why I am wasting my time hanging out with friends? I could be spending all of this time to further develop my skills and gain new experiences. In college that mindset has hit me even harder. I see all of these college kids socializing having fun wasting away their time that could have been used to study or work or to do something productive. As I grew older and learned more about whats available in the world I decided that my interests and work ethics match me well for a Chief Technology Officer career. I like the science and technology side of how things work and I have done much RampD research in college. I also like the business side leadership skills and challenges involved. Since I am already working as hard as a CTO i thought this dream position would also fit me as well. I am considering a PhD as well since many CTOs do have it. But PhD students also work hrs a week so they can graduate on time.Because I have been so heavily invested in this mindset reality just hit me. I am incredibly tired internally as well. I have not had any vacations in the past two years. During Christmas break I stayed at school and worked on my projects. I worked as well during spring break. As soon as summer started I started my internship. And as soon as my internship ended I came back to school to continue working on my project. This negative time is money mindset of mine also repelled a lot of friends. They want me to go out and have some fun but I pessimistically reminded them that they are wasting their time having fun and could be doing something much more productive. So now I also feel quite lonely with not many friends to reach out to.Not only that but my social skills are lacking and I still have not had my first girlfriend or my first kiss yet at the age of . I have tried to pursue girls actually but my mindset was I need to get a girlfriend so I can get this over with and continue focusing on my career which let to numerous downfalls.Now that I am reflecting I have focused on my career so much that I gave up everything else in my life. It is really hard for me to swing out of this mindset that I have had for the past years.I am starting to think CTO is not something I want to do if it means sacrificing another years down the road. I want to convert my mindset to live a working life and come back home worry free to enjoy other aspects of life that I am currently missing out on.I hope someone can help me. I feel so miserable right now although Im not worried about my career options after I graduate.Thanks so much! UpdateThank you everyone for helping me to clarify the problem with my current views.

The justification for this is usually the argument that the prefix a means not so atheism must mean not theist. I believe this is mistaken. First the dictionary definition Definition of atheism the belief that there is no God. disbelief in the existence of a supreme being or beings. Read More These are clearly binary statements showing hard stances of beliefdisbelief not a lack of belief. Note that these are the only two definitions on dictionary.com. Websters dictionary is much the same using disbelief and doctrine to describe atheism. Compare this with agnosticDefinition of agnostic person who believes that the existence of God is unknown and unknowable or that human knowledge is limited to experience. Read More This is a lack of belief. The synonym study clarifies that an agnostic refrains from commitment to any religious doctrine while an atheist has a doctrine that there is no God. Now some people claim that there is such thing as Gnostic and agnostic atheism. These seem to be very modern labels people use to escape the argument that atheists disbelieve in God by saying they are agnostic atheists. Now these terms dont seem to be recognized by any major dictionary but from their usage it seems to mean that a Gnostic atheist faithfully states that there is no God with a sense of certainty while an agnostic atheist says that there is no God but we dont have proof? Ive yet to have someone really clarify this in a way that makes sense to me. Heres the thing if you state that there is definitely no God on your faith alone that isnt Gnostic atheism that is just atheism! If you say we dont have proof but there is probably no God that falls within agnosticism. If you say there is no proof but there is definitely no God yet this somehow isnt a decision of faith i dont think there is a particular word for that because you are talking out of your in a sense there. So maybe agnostic atheism is the word to use here but it is a corruption of both words in this case. Some anticipated counterpointsWe should let people label themselves as whatever they want. No because this confuses the argument and not only makes it difficult to understand what the other person is trying to say and to state things clearly yourself it allows dishonest commentators to constantly say no you havent proven me wrong because Im really this ad nauseum. The current definitions are too broad. We can easily narrow them down by saying I am an agnostic who believes our existing knowledge makes God almost impossible but we dont have the evidence to prove the theory of God wrong instead of misusing words which already have a definition and causing confusion. Agnostics have no doctrine so they cant say that there isisnt a God which means there needs to be a word between I just dont know and atheism. I think this is the strongest argument as doctrine means principle or belief and isnt necessarily limited to a yesno binary dynamic. Still it seems much clearer and more logical to say Im agnostic but there is probably no god than to say Im an agnostic atheist so there is no god but there is also no proof but this isnt a matter of faith. Agnostic atheism seems hypocritical to me. Also see the Socratic definition below. Also those people who do identify and use these words properly shouldnt be forced to relabel themselves simply because internet goers got it wrong. Its also unclear whether most people get the word wrong or if its just the reddit community and a few other forums. Id love to see information based on academic texts or politicalnews discussions. .....I truly welcome anyone to correct my definitions of Gnostic and agnostic atheism. As I said i couldnt find official definitions and Ive only heard the terms used online so Im basing their definitions on that context and my own limited analysis. Otherwise change my views here that atheism is a hard beliefdisbelief and agnosticism is the soft version and that gnosticagnostic atheism is a misappropriation of these words to create definitions which already exist as other words and that this is harmful to clear honest discussion of the topic.At the moment Im getting mostly down votes for a post I put a lot of thought into and have commented on every response to. Are you down voting because you disagree with me or because you think Im unwilling to change my view? Also no one has so far addressed anything beyond what is the correct definition of these words today. The point that the original definition of atheist was binary has not been challenged nor has the idea that binary is clearer. Some people have said that the definitions used on ratheism are the ones real atheists use but have given very little evidence of this. Im open to that idea but since the dictionary which reflects real language use all academics Ive spoken to and nearly every atheist Ive met in person all use the classic definition I havent been given any reason to think it extends beyond reddit and the writings of Richard Dawkins. I argue back hard and ask you to give me evidence but provide that and Ill happily change my view. I do acknowledge that of the major English dictionaries Oxford does include lack of belief as part of its definition of atheism for the US and Britain but that is also inconsistent with its definition of agnosticism in its US English section. It seems Dawkins and other modern writers may have had a pronounced effect on the current definition in the British entries in the Oxford dictionary. The other major dictionaries do not seem to include lack of belief only disbelief. My view is also changed in that several important groups and a significant number though not all of individuals define themselves by the inclusive definition of atheism which is a spectrum not binary. This type of usage really does change the definition of the word even if it makes it less clear. Conclusion atheism should be officially updated to be inclusive based on widespread use and self identification with the term in discussion it is best to clarify how youre using the word from the start or avoid using such charged language I still believe the inclusive definition is unclear and technically incorrect but those drawbacks are outweighed by colloquial understanding and selfidentification in most contexts.

In summary anywhere you smoke youre being inconsiderate to other people.I cant really think of any situation in which smoking is not inconsiderate.

Infact most of us are white. Many muslims especially Turkish but they dont stand out that much either. So it this offends you be considerate and think about being in my shoes with a different society. Browsing through reddit I noticed oftentimes that remarks that immediately sound racist to americans are perceived very neutrally here. We do have foreigners being from Italian descent Im a foreigner in Germany myself but I dont look that much different to Germans. Yet sometimes I get asked if I run a pizzashop just because Im Italian and many Italians actually do have a restaurant or sell ice cream or something like that. That is not considerate to be racist or offensive here. But Im here to hear you out from a US perspective. END OF DISCLAIMERAnyway I was surprised at some of the examples in the video. I know its the point to show people that theyre being racist while not even realizing it. I get it. But I have a hard time seeing whats wrong about excluding a race in your sexual preference. Now if the argument is that its racist because Im actually making a difference depending on the race then why is it OK to be sexist making a difference on gender? If the argument to that is Well you didnt choose to like women men but you choose to dislike a race then wouldnt we start to ride a socialjusticerollercoaster that would continue on to other minorities traits or features? Not OK to dislike dating Redheads? Not OK to dislike dating elderly people? Not OK to dislike dating handicapped people? Until we get to our final destination that sounds like you just dont wanna date her because shes ugly! Youre discriminating ugly people.Maybe you say its racist because such a statement would express that I think all e.g. black people share a common trait while they dont necessarily have to meaning its racist to pigeonhole an entire race. But then again whats the deal with doing so? For all that matters the term asian black hispanic is putting people into drawers already so thats racist already no? Again I hope not to offend anyone.

The former is something I rarely hear supported but is at least unambiguous in its meaning everyone has the same life quality in terms of health wealth education etc. Only people with a view of the world heavily slanted towards nurture believe this is possible and most accept it is beyond the remit of government to achieve it so far as I can tell.But equality of opportunity despite appearing to be meaningful at first glance is actually nonsense or at least as ambiguous as equality. Does this mean starting everyone from a same footing which would involve compensating for background and genetic discrepancies or simply applying the same provision to everyone? I dont view it as within the power of the state to arrange human affairs so that every child can have an equal chance of prospering at school and even if it was possible I think the destruction of freedom and family life it would entail would be deeply wounding. On the other hand spending the same resources on every child seems equally callous squandering talent at the top while potentially not allocating enough to the disadvantaged at the bottom. As for the legal system equality could seemingly apply to equal rules applied universally regardless of background factors class character etc or attempting to compensate for those factors in the name of fairness. I think theres probably elements of both approaches in our legal system which limits equality to a principle of not being spuriously discriminatory on grounds of race sex and so on. I suppose Im more of a basic standards kind of guy believing there should be a minimum amount of education health and housing that the state should endeavour to provide but otherwise citizens should be left to it.

It probably takes more athleticism to run a competitive marathon time or endure an MMA fight. I will say that I cant immediately think of a more strategic sport than football more on that in a bit. Though football isnt the greatest in all three categories it requires a great deal of each.Skill is probably the weakest of the three criteria for football but football is unique in the number and variety of skills required to make a football team function each position has to do things the others dont. Quarterbacks have to be able to assess the movements of the other players all at once and hit a small rapidly moving target. Receivers have to catch a ball while running at full tilt with less than a second to get a visual lock. Linemen use a type of wrestling technique to clear the way for running backs or shut down running backsattack the quarterback in the case of the defensive line. Kickers and punters have to kick with considerable precision over great distances. Defenders have to take down pound men running full speed without committing a foul this requires technique and precision not just strength. I dont think there are many other sports where the rolesskills of each position are as distinct. While its true that play stops and starts frequently every second of active play is done at full intensity. Theres never a period reserving energy or waiting for a situation to develop or waiting for the action to come back to the other side of the field The only time play slows down is in the late stages of the game when one team has a substantial lead. Linemen have to wrestle pound men with all their might for the entire game. Offensive players have to run at full speed every play while enduring repeated physical trauma. Defenders also have to run at full speed and exert enough strength to knock down other players doing the same. I think football could almost be likened to highintensity interval training with the added twist of getting knocked to the ground repeatedly by large men. This requires a great deal of athleticism and endurance.Where football especially shines is strategy. Each play requires all players on the field to carry out a very specific action. Players have to memorize a playbook with dozens to hundreds of plays and be able to execute these actions perfectly from memory. If even one or two players of the on a side fails to carry out the play correctly the play will likely fall apart. Each play is carefully selected based on a great deal of factors including the strengths and weaknesses of the players on the field the position of the ball on the field whether or not the clock is moving how much time is left the score and how many downs are remaining. But whats especially unique is that coaches have to predict what the other team will do and outwit them. Football is the only sport where players spend as much time on the intellectual aspects of the game learning strategy and studying other teams strategies as they do developing skills and conditioning their bodies. Football is an on threehour chess match. No other sport has strategy that involves that level of detail.I invite you to change my view by demonstrating that another sport requires a great deal of all three criteria and the sum of that sport is greater than that of American football.'},\n {'id': 't3_2hcri1',\n  'titles': 'There is no moral obligation to be a productive member of society',\n  'argument': 'Simply put and to be as cliched as possible you only get one life to lead and if someones Idea of happiness is to be free of responsibilities and just coast by that is there right even if it makes it slightly harder for the rest of us.

The narrative goes that once that starts to happen on a large scale people who are not part of a small privileged minority who own the means of production will see a dramatic and permanent decrease in their quality of life. This view is probably best presented by this fantastic video Humans Need Not Apply To be clear I am not arguing against the idea that robots and computers will someday replace mostall existing jobs. Im arguing against the idea that it will make us less well off and nobody will be able to find a job.I disagree mainly with this views long term conclusions. Eliminating jobs through technology can only result in a society with more wealth for everyone. In my opinion thinking that large scale automation results in a lower standard of living for most people shows an ignorance of economics and a failure to take into account all the effects automation would have in the long run. Here is my reasoning...First lets look at how improved technology benefits an industry and some examples of what thats looked like in the past. Its fairly easy to show that in the near term automating away jobs in one particular industry benefits everyone else while harming the people in that industry. When refrigeration started becoming widespread ice suppliers were soon wiped out while everyone elses quality of life increased dramatically. Yes ice suppliers used to be a thing. Over the past years longshoremen have found themselves less and less needed while everyone else enjoys cheaper and more reliable oversea bulk freight resulting in cheaper... everything really. Also note that there was a lot of political outcry because of both technological improvements. People saw jobs being eliminated and talked about how the new technology will make everyone poorer. They were wrong of course.In the long term the harming of a particular industry ceases to be a problem because the industry gets replaced by new industries with different jobs jobs that result in better lives for people than the old industry ever did. Instead of ice suppliers we have the jobs in other industries that the increase in efficiency of refrigeration allows being able to refrigerate things for much cheaper and for longer caused a boom in a lot of other industries such as farming transportation restauranteuring food and beverage manufacturing etc. Not to mention the people that make and service the freezers that replaced the ice suppliers. In all more jobs were eventually created by refrigeration than refrigeration replaced. And up to this point in human history this is what all technology has done in the long run. Every useful invention so far has made our lives better.Most people who hold the view that future automation will harm most people respond along the lines that its different this time because technology wont replace one industry but nearly every industry. First of all this view generalizes the negatives without generalizing the corresponding positives... namely if nearly every industry is automated away we will see a corresponding increase in quality and quantity of nearly all goods. And the corresponding plummet in prices. If the production of a car from mining of raw materials to assembly to sales is all automated how much will that car cost? A lot less. Secondly and most importantly this view looks at job elimination and assumes its permanent. This is nonsense if history is to be our guide. In the new hypothetical world of abundant dirtcheap quality goods and services most people will find some new way to make a living. Just because we dont know what that way is doesnt mean it wont happen.Note that I dont necessarily think that automation wont hurt some people or make some people poorer. I think that this will happen in the short term and we ought to come up with some support system for this. But in the long term automation can only help. years after that dark time things will be looking different. years after things will be amazing.Though I feel strongly about this subject now I am definitely open to having my view changed. The idea that automation will hurt people in a long term way seems to be pretty widespread but I havent seen any convincing arguments for it that take all the effects of automation into account.'},\n {'id': 't3_2h4eyz',\n  'titles': 'People angry at vertical videos are ignoring the trend of technology to move to mobile formats',\n  'argument': 'Preface I searched for this topic and two s came up but neither really touched on this aspect.People get annoyed or angry at videos that are taken in a vertical format mostly because screens are horizontal.

Contemporary Religions Cause Human Rights AbusesAll contemporary religions instruct their followers to conduct abuses of human rights as part of their religion. Contemporary Christianity when followed based on exact instructions rather than its spirit that is general guidelines and recurring themes which are presented throughout the Holy Bible instructs its practitioners to kill maim and torture anyone who happens to violate its codes. While truly literal Christians are a rarity even in the most fundamentalist circles largely due to syncretic difficulties with the currently existing laws and not because of a lack of motive to be even more extremist it is extremely common among more fundamentalist Christians to engage in such things as sexualorientation based discrimination child abuse and worse. Other religions such as Islam are just as bad or even worse in this respect. Some would argue that not all Christians are like this but.... If There Is Religion There Will Be FundamentalistsAs society begins to leave its spiritual and superstitious roots behind and move on many who are raised in or have found religion leave behind fundamentalism and become more moderate or liberal. This may even extend to the point where the strict moral code of the religion is left behind and instead the religious belief is used for moral support or emotional uplifting. If we could just get all the fundies to follow in their footsteps wed be golden right?...The answer is no. As long as there are Christians even in the loosest sense there will be a few who open up their Bible and read what it has to say. Some of those people will convince their fellow Christians to become more fundamentalist. Others will simply become radicalized by themselves becoming potential lone wolves. In any case the further from Biblical morals their society is the more fault they will see with it and the more anger they will express. This anger could be expressed in highly nonproductive ways a la Eric Rudolph. The only solution to this problem seems to be completely eradicating all traces of offending religions. Now one could argue that this would bring about backlashes definitely from the fundies and likely from the less strict religious and perhaps even nonreligious human rights protectors who so valiantly guard the freedom of ideology they cherish but that is also not a total stop to this because.... Were Already On Our WayThink about how much progress developed countries have made away from religion in the last few decades. We have successfully removed religion from places where it is neither needed nor wanted such as schools in many cases. Of course there are exceptions many classrooms are still religious in nature and there will always be the religious folk who dont partake in such heathenery and instead homeschool their children so they can receive the necessary dose of brainwashing but we have made a ton of progress. Despite the protests of the angry fundies this is not poised to slow down stop or reverse at any point in the remotely foreseeable future.. Does It Violate Freedom Of Expression? Not ReallyFreedom of Expression like all rights has its limits. The right to speak freely doesnt apply if you knowingly accuse someone of a crime they did not commit. The right to bear arms doesnt apply if you are manufacturing weapons of mass destruction. And similarly people cannot be allowed to hold irrational views which cause damage to society.Think about it like this. A person who believes black people are inferior to white people can go his entire life without ever committing a hate crime. Even though he considers black people his inferior nothing about this views compels him to ever kill steal from or even refuse a job to a black person. His view is irrelevant but it might predispose him to actions which can be dealt with separately.Compare this to Christianity. The Bible actually encourages its followers to commit abuses against human rights in many different forms. Because of this a person who sincerely believes in the Bible is compelled to perform this actions and harm others in doing so. The fundamentalist cannot reconcile these syncretic difficulties and he is forced to obey his religious text over the law of the land because he cannot reconcile his beliefs.. There Is No Evidence Any God Of The Contemporary Form ExistsAll these human rights abuses would be acceptable even necessary if it was proven that the God of the Bible or the Quran or the Torah was a real entity. However not one shred of legitimate scientific evidence has ever been unearthed which would show the existence of such an entity. Instead we are left with selfcontradictory texts which make many untrue predictions to the point that anyone with even a moderate degree of knowledge of both theological and proper scientific fields could not reconcile its absurdity without resorting to willful ignorance. Most believers are ignorant in the traditional sense in that they do not even know what they are truly supposed to be believing.End. ConclusionContemporary religions are all irrational belief systems that are almost certainly untrue. They violate human rights by their very nature and society would make significant progress if religion could be outlawed without unmanageable social backlash.

Obviously neither physics nor philosophy are useful for collecting trivia type knowledge. Also I concede that philosophy has better tools equipped to understand moral truths. However when it comes to understanding and discovering general characteristics belonging to existing things I believe that physics is superior to philosophy. Here are a few reasons why. Philosophy since it is not experimental in nature merely reorganizes knowledge and does not produce any new knowledge. Descriptions in mathematics are less ambiguous more strictly logical and lead to greater insights than descriptions in English or any other language. Ideas in physics are much easier to test. Philosophy has no defense against counterintuitive truths such as objects have a probabilistic rather than a defined set of characteristics.

Known socially asWhite.Each of these people brings up an interesting side of biracial perceptions. It used to be that any race mixed with caucasian would automatically be cancelled out. Obama is half black half white but people call him black Tiger Woods is an amalgamation of racs and people call him black. However in recent years these social rules seemed to change somewhat with racially charged cases like Zimmerman being referred to as white despite having a darker race of peruvian ancestry from his mothers side. Romney himself does not acknowledge as latino even though George Romney was from Mexico defaulting to white to appeal to his base. What is the point of all of this? Its that our terminology for classifying people seems to be outdated as more and more biracial people have come into American life and we need to rethink the logic behind it.Some might say that its wrong to label people but identity is important. Obama has written about how he struggled to decide whether he was white or black as a youth a society that could barely understand the idea of mixed race forced him to choose between one side of his ancestry or the other when he should have accepted both. Tiger Woods calls himself Cablinasian or Multicultural. which gives a fair homage to all sides of his family. Referring to someone who is biracial by only one of their races ultimately discredits one or more people who played a part in that person being alive. Whether it is done socially or whether it is done voluntarily like with Romney which is still brought by social pressures. I think that this approach of categorization is fundementally wrong and illogical because it ultimately makes a person deny a big part of themselves and their family. Instead of referring to someone of mixed race as one race there should be new terms invented to better suit who they are. Woods approach with Cablinasian and other variations such as Eurasian or simply Multicultural being accepted into mainstream culture would be of a great benefit and a welcome addition to the lexicon for a society becoming more and more multicultural by the day.Thats my stance please change my view.'},\n {'id': 't3_2gsjt4',\n  'titles': 'This is a logical argument Gay people and straight people have the same marriage rights in the US',\n  'argument': 'This is something my fairly offensive dad told me and I want him to be wrong about it but I cant figure out WHY its wrong.Basically the argument goes as suchHeterosexuals have the right to marry someone of the opposite sex.

For those that god forbid dont already knowCalzones have several virtues over pizza. Calzones are easy to transport cleanly. By virtue of being surrounded by dough no sauce or toppings are going to spill during transportation making carrying a calzone a largely risk free proposition. Calzones maintain their temperature better over distances because their encompassing crust acts as insulation for the pipping hot toppings in the center. As any New Yorker will tell you the proper way to eat pizza is to fold it in half with each end of the crust pointing upwards and the crust itself enveloping the toppings. Sound familiar? It should because its a calzone! Calzones can be filled with more ingredients than a typical pizza by virtue of their design. Since they are a stuffed bread there is little risk of excess toppings threatening the structural integrity of the calzone. With a pizza the more you put on the greater the risk to the integrity of the pizza particularly when you take an individual slice. Ever had ingredients slide off the top of a pizza slice just as you were about to take a bite? Sounds like a bit of a food engineering problem. Allow me to introduce the solution calzones. Calzones reduce wast. Calzones can be baked more readily to sizes fitting an individual portion. Personal pizzas are possible but are rarely seen in the pizza world. Pizza is a group food and most restaurants provide that option. To help meet individual needs slices are offered. However this introduces the problem of waste. If slices remain unsold what remains of a pizza will inevitably be thrown out. This is wasteful! Calzones dont have that problem. Calzones are generally made to order for the individual in a size an individual can eat. One calzone for one person. No waste!To me the answer is clear. We should become a calzone nation. Thank you Benn Wyatt for revealing the truth. Presentation. Pizza can be presented visually in ways a calzone cannot. Preparation. Pizza can be cooked in ways that produce an ideal outcome in terms of flavor a way that calzones cannot because the toppings are directly exposed to heat. Pizza is a superior social food as it is more easily shared. Pizza can at least approximate some of the advantages of a calzone by folding a slice in half. Calzones have to have more bread relative to the number of toppings this is disputed but if true it is certainly a point in pizzas favor Moisture buildup is a problem if you add too many moist toppings into a calzone. This prevents certain combinations in a calzone that can be put on a pizza and is why many times sauces are delivered as a separate item in a ramekin. Calzones cool slower and less evenly making it difficult to eat on the spot and meaning that you will get an uneven flavor experience. These are all very good points. I will have to think this over more.

There are many companies that do this by making customers happy and giving themselves a good public image but any good that is done by a company is an amoral action. Likewise any bad that is done by a company is also an amoral action. Companies will do bad things if they are shown to be more profitable. The only way to stop this from happening is to make bad things less profitable. Legislation is a great way to do this but like everything has its caveats. As long as it is profitable for companies to influence legislation against the good of the people it will be done. They will fight against others to keep it profitable and to make it more profitable. The question is how do you keep bad things from being profitable and at the same time prevent business exodus? That really is the only issue. We dont need to keep them happy we just need to keep them from leaving.

Correct me if Im wrong. So it shouldnt be too hard to find a potential wife that is at least in the same income bracketrange as the man correct? A man who marries a woman so far outside his income bracket is comparable to a man who invests and starts a business with a homeless bum and expects to share the losses if things go south. Why are men marrying women in what seems like large numbers based on the abovelinked post who have little to no earning ability? Why are they starting business partnerships with them? Why is it so hard to find a wife that has a job? Is the jobless rate for women that high? Or are unemployed and uneducated women simply more attractive?

Multiculturalism is the way of the world and Im all for it. Plus immigrants bring fresh ideas and delicious food. Not to mention that English is an insanely difficult language even for native speakers so Im not going to begrudge people for speaking it with an accent.What I do have a problem with is people who speak English fluently and with an American accent suddenly lapsing into another accent to say a specific word. This mainly arises with Latinos using identity markers latino chicano or foods quesadilla. However most of these words have been adopted into English as true loanwords English speakers understand them and use them often. But I often hear people on the news e.g. a policy analyst of LatinAmerican extraction using words like latino with a Spanish lilt that sounds to me outofplace and exaggerated.Suddenly switching to another accent at best is confusing as it takes the listeners brain that extra millisecond to adapt to a new style of speaking. At worst it sounds kind of pretentious and exclusionary.Im not arguing that we should completely anglify these words I dont want to hear someone pronounce quesadilla with a hard L sound like the grandma in Napoleon Dynamite. Rather I think we should treat Spanish loanwords like we do words like kindergarden German sake Japanese or joie de vivre French try as best we can to respect the original pronunciation but maintain our typical accent when saying them.Doing otherwise is just kind of disrespectful. To illustrate I am a reasonably proficient Spanish speaker and have spent a lot of time in Spanishspeaking countries. Once I was speaking with a local edit in Spanish and used the word iPod which left him scratching his head. I couldnt figure out why I knew in fact that he owned one too. Then it hit me I was pronouncing the i sound like the English eye which is a confusing sound for Spanish speakers especially when surrounded by Spanish words.

The Stratocaster has been played by greats such as Jimi Hendrix and Eric Clapton. The Les Paul has been the mainstay of other great guitarists such as Slash and Zakk Wylde. By reputation alone either guitar would appear to be vitally important throughout the history of all forms of rock music. However I believe that the Stratocaster has a few important areas where it is superior. The Stratocaster is much more common in other genres of music than the Les Paul is. Great Blues artists like Buddy Guy Robert Cray and Stevie Ray Vaughan all are known for playing Stratocasters. While country music is more known for the Stratocasters sibling the Telecaster you will see country artists like Vince Gill play a Stratocaster from time to time.A good guitarist can get a wide range of sounds out of either the Les Paul or the Stratocaster but I believe the Stratocaster can offer more. Les Paul type guitars are equipped with dual coil humbucker pickups which combined with the weight and materials of the guitar are the reason for their iconic deep resonating sound. To make them more versatile most modern Les Pauls are equipped with coil tapping or coil splitting. The result is that you can make the pickups act more like a single coil. This eliminates the humbucking sort of a form of noise cancellation and sounds more stratlike. However it is still very far from the iconic honk you can get with a single coil Fender pickup. Most Stratocasters come in the SSS configuration which is three single coil pickups. If you turn up the volume on the guitar all the way and place the pickup selector to position it uses the middle and neck pickup together and sounds more similar to the sound you would get with a humbuckerequipped guitar than the humbuckerequipped guitars can sound like single coil. If that is not sufficient and you vastly prefer the sound of humbuckers Fender makes HSH and other pickup layouts to give you humbuckers. Ive never tried these so I cant really comment on them.Another feature that I feel is superior in the Stratocaster is the shape of the components of the guitar. The flat fretboard on the Les Paul has the strings a little too close together for my taste in comparison to the more roomy Stratocaster. Also the thinner neck makes it easier for me to wrap my thumb around if I were trying to play some chords similarly to how Jimi Hendrix would play them. The cutaway design of the body is much easier to deal with on the Stratocaster and allows easier access to the higher frets. The bridge is another factor for me since the bridge on the Les Paul sticks out further while the bridge on the Stratocaster is much lower making it easier to move your hand around while sticking close to the body of the guitar. That being said I will give some points to the Les Paul for the angled head being superior as well as the tuners being better on most Les Pauls that Ive played. That doesnt negate the other concerns though.To summarize I own and play both a Stratocaster and a Les Paul. My next guitar will probably be a PRS Custom because I feel like it provides a really good middle ground and has its own unique improvements over each. I love both guitars but I like my Stratocaster a little bit more. Change my view and explain to me how the Gibson Les Paul is a superior guitar.'},\n {'id': 't3_2fh3qu',\n  'titles': 'Rape without evidence should not be treated as a criminal case',\n  'argument': 'Ive been bothered by all of the discussions about rape for a long time and I think Ive finally figured out whyRape is the only crime Im aware of where you can accuse someone and potentially even get them punished without real evidence.If I accused someone of robbing me the first that would be demanded is evidence. Without any evidence nobody would take my accusation seriously.But because so often theres no evidence in a rape case its become acceptable for evidenceless accusations to be taken seriously. Simply being accused of rape can get people fired from their jobs and destroy their life.Heres a great example of this where a student is carrying around a mattress until their accused rapist is expelled At that point what their doing has nothing to do with the legal system theyre just shaming the entire system until someone gives into their demands. Thats not how it works. If theres not enough evidence to accuse someone of the crime if the court turns it down then you cant convict them. Period.Its not the court being blind to rape victims its that its better to let guilty people escape than to let one innocent suffer an established part of our legal system.In the end I wholeheartedly agree that rape is a horrible thing that we need to find a solution to.

It doesnt make the act any more justifiable and rape is rape. I believe this to be true. I feel empathy for rape victims. Ive heard this compared to the Fappening many times.The victims privacy was violated. Its their prerogative to take whatever pictures they want and share them or not as long as no laws were violated e.g. being underage and no other people were hurt by the act. I agree with this.Where Im having trouble bridging the gap is here. There are laws in certain places saying that when a pedestrian is waiting at a crosswalk with no signals walk signs traffic lights etc. cars must stop and let the pedestrians cross. I know a friend that knows this law and doesnt really wait at the crossings assuming that cars will stop for him given a reasonable amount of time and space. Most people will wait until the cars actually stop. If he ever gets hit by a car at such a crosswalk it will be the drivers fault. The fact that someone else didnt follow the rules doesnt make my friend get hit by a car any less nor does it reduce the painfulness of the incident. Hes paying for it with his body and the law will probably make the driver pay for it as well. I would not feel bad for said friend because he took a risk with no possible reward got screwed by someone who didnt follow the rules and my friend ended up paying for it.By the same token I dont feel bad for the victims of the Fappening. At the same time I feel bad that I dont feel bad and as much as I hate the phrase it comes to mind here. Im sorry that Im not sorry.

In that sense hyperrealistic works of art are vain narcissistic but beyond that pointless.A post came across my Facebook timeline a few days ago from Fubiz entitled Ultrarealistic Paintings by Matt Story. As with most posts on hyperrealistic drawings or paintings it got plenty of likes and ooohs and aaahs. I think hyperrealism is a bunch of bull however. To explain Id like to propose a couple of short thought experimentA man walks in a museum and comes across three identical photorealistic images hanging on the wall. His friend told him that one is a photograph one is a painting and one is a CGI rendering but you cant tell which is which. Other than knowing that the images were created using three separate methods they look exactly alike. The man looks at the information plate on the wall below each image. The image in the middle is the photograph. This is just a photo of some fruit in a kitchen I couldve taken that. The image on the left is the CGI rendering. Well I guess you can do anything on a computer these days. The image on the right is the painting. Wow I cant believe someone painted this! This is a masterpiece! A museum guide comes over looks at the information plates and says Im sorry sir someone changed these plates again. The image on the left is the photo the middle one the painting and the one on the right the CGI rendering. The man responds Oh well then the left one is the masterpiece!Thought experiment Ten years from now D printing has advanced to the point where creating a lifesized model of a person is as easy as taking a photograph of someone. All of a sudden anyone can create a sculpture as realistic as any of Duane Hanson Some artists however continue making realistic sculptures the hard way with no discernible difference in outcome.I contend that the only difference between photography and hyperrealism is the degree of difficulty in creating the image. If sculpting technology makes realistic sculpting easier were a lot closer to thought experiment than you might expect than the only difference between lifelike sculptures becomes the process of creation. This is why I find the mans reaction in thought experiment so absurd and the artists in experiment who go the hard way vain and narcisstic. The image should be judged on the merit of itself not how it came to be. I could find arbitrarily difficult methods for creating the most mundane images and a lot of hyperrealistic subject matters seems to me to be rather banal but that doesnt make those images in and of themselves more compelling.If you create something which differentiates itself from another creation in no other way than having been harder to create the whole point of that creation becomes the process. In other words all that hyperrealistic artists seem to say is hey look at how amazing my skills are! I couldve just taken a photograph to show you the same image and I probably used a photograph to copy but I wanted everyone to see my awesome replicating skills! How is this not just an act of egostroking vanity and narcissism?I read elsewhere that the point of hyperrealism is to challenge our notion of what is real that you cannot trust your own eyes. By deceiving the viewer into believing something is real when it really isnt since it was painteddrawnetc. you make the viewer question the nature or reality itself. This is of course if the viewer can get over their amazement of the technical prowess of the artist to begin with. The thing that this purpose if thats what it is to challenge a viewers thoughts on whats real fails to reckon with is that photography itself is not real. Theres a story I remember reading cant source it unfortunately about a conversation between Picasso and a fellow train traveler who wonders why Picasso paints what he does. Picasso says I paint what I see. The man pulls out a photo from his wallet and says something to the effect of but thats not reality. See this photograph of my wife thats real. To which Picasso answers Youre wifes head is inches tall?The point is photographs are just representations of reality not reality itself. When a shallow depth of field puts parts of the image out of focus those areas arent in reality fuzzy all of a sudden its just how the camera interprets the light. Every little decision you make with a camera or which it makes for you influences how the camera captures and interprets the image. A photograph is the result of a complex interaction of light and the camera. Indeed when the actual creation of the camera is taken into account of the making of a photograph it turns out to be vastly more complex than painting a hyperrealistic painting. But lets limit ourself to the act of the buttonpusher. A photograph depicts the end result of this complex process between light and camera.In fact photography is much more successful in pretending to be real than hyperrealistic images ever could be because people actual think photos are real! And if hyperrealisms stated aim is to confound the boundaries between whats real and isnt by tricking the viewer than dont photoshopped images to job much more successfully? Or what about the fact that of Ikeas catalog is now computer generated Certainly fooled me. Is this the point of hyperrealism?What does that leave hyperrealism with then? The creational process. And really thats what gets the ooohs and aaahs isnt it? The realization that something handmade tricked you into thinking it was a photograph and an amazement for the skills of artist. This is not to say that we cannot or should not be awed by an act of creation. It is impressive to what degree artists can create photorealistic art. It takes time patience and technical skill to accomplish. But the end result should be judged on its own merit not on the extent to which it highlights the virtues of the artist. And since the end results of hyperrealistic art offers nothing beyond what a photograph could offer other than inflating the ego of the artist it is truly pointless.Would love for you to change my mind!

One of the most common is that gay marriage somehow cheapens their marriage or that marriage is between defined as being between a man and a woman.

So right off the bat to take this stand against gay marriage is being intolerant against certain forms of christianity. Many Buddhist sects are also accepting of gay marriage. So when you look at the fact that multiple different religions have opposing views how could you possibly come to any conclusion other than the fact that you are being intolerant of other religious traditions? The part of my title that mentions civil unions is a response to another common argument by anti gay marriage advocates which is that they just dont think it should be called marriage between same sex partners. This still falls under the category of being intolerant because you are trying to dictate what their religious beliefs label their union but it brings up another concern. If you think that marriage is a religious term why do you think the government should be issuing marriage certificates to anybody when we are supposed to have a separation of church and state in this country?

In a working environment where you might have to greet many people each morning a fistbump saves time which could be spent working on important projects while still convincing your colleagues that you are happy to see them.

Not everyone wants to or is able to play the capitalists game. They currently get our scraps. The problem is we are getting stingy with our scraps.The new LawsNow laws have been passed requiring welfare recipients to pass drug tests to continue receiving aid. I think this is a bad idea for many reasons including costs. However the primary reason for me to not want to sneakily dismantle welfare is because the aid is intended to help children. No one gives a shit about the parents and for good reason fuck em. We are trying a trickle down approach to feeding children and single mothers. If welfare were to be rapidly dismantled I believe the US would be in a worse state. Even holding conservative views I believe welfare is a necessary evil.

Firstly the distinction between private and public. To me something is private when its ownership belongs to an exclusive group of people. In this case the group was the photo takers and whoever they shared those photos with Apple not withstanding. When the hacker obtained the photos and released them to the public the group was nonexclusive now anybody who has access to a computer can view the photos and thus the photos arent private theyre public. Ideally those photos should belong to the photo takers and thus those who spread the photos are spreading ownership and making them more public which is wrong. Id like to remind everyone I dont think what the hacker and those who share the images are right. Now that the photos are public its not a matter of privacy to view the photos. I can still be mad at the NSA for breaching my privacy however if the NSA made my information or others public I could not be mad at them for solely looking at it as long as they didnt do anything with the information. I would still be mad at the NSA as I am with the hacker however unlike my private information you cant use the leaked pictures to hack into my bank account or find out where I live or find out where I go to school.With that said Id like like to make my points a little clearer for easier view changing What the hacker and the people who spread the images do are wrong.

If you then manage to maintain sobriety you will then be considered in line with status quo again arguably lower even then since you became addicted in the first place.Some people stay sober their entire lives and are never given accolades or congratulations. The same should logically apply to former addicts.

Furthermore crimes such as petty theft or assault are frequently commited during addiction and these crimes are seen as forgiven or forgotten once a person achieves sobriety as if resolving the individual of responsibility for his actions as well as his choices.This is NOT a drugs use .

In many places this includes a cash handout. I believe this is wrong on many levels. The money may be misspent. This idea is NOT based on the assumption that poor people are all stupid or drug addicts. Its simply the fact that theres no way of ensuring that the cash is used for its intended purpose. The best assumption you can make is that people would be so desperately craving the thing you give them extra money for that they would almost certainly spend it on that but people may end up endure forms of squalor that were far from what the well intentioned policy makers had in mind. From the governments perspective money is also being spent inefficiently. Lets say a program wanted to ensure that people were well fed. Theyd have to find a cash amount that would buy enough healthy food to feed the recipients but people have different needs so theyll have to provide to the upper percentile of demand the alternative is weighing people paying women less etc. This not only will result in discretionary income but inequality in how much everyone gets. A food stamp system would allow everyone to get as much food as they need and the money left over is still in the governments hands to spend on other initiatives. Things like food stamps are patronising and thats a good thing. A cash handout creates a sense of entitlement beyond what something patronising like food stamps rent vouchers etc. create. By the time moneys in your pocket or bank account theres several layers between you and the people providing that service. Food stamps create a meaningful difference between working poor and welfare recipients to encourage escaping the system. Theres also the huge benefit of less resentment of those on welfare. In general they communicate purpose more clearly. Too often theres an attitude of getting as much money as you can from the government and paying as little tax as possible. It seems like people would be less likely to trick their way into receiving food stamps education and other initiatives purpose built to meet needs. On the other side I would think policies would allow people to see their taxes as less of a redistribution of wealth and more as funding for benevolent programs to create a better society.I think as much welfare as possible should be in the form of vouchers and other purpose specific non discretionary forms. I like food stamps I like rent vouchers I like free healthcare and education. Things like these over cash seem like the best way to prevent the safety net becoming a fishing net. I cant think of many situations where cash is the best option which is why Im here.The other aspect to this changemyview is that Im ok with policies that patronise the less fortunate. Being well fed healthy comfortably sheltered continually educated to eventually earn the life you want are more important than not being insulted.

It should be eradicated to the point of only increasing or decreasing based off the economy at that point in time. As of now its the federal government stepping in and increasing the state MW. It should be there as a measurement of the inflation of currency and state of the market and to avoid any unfair affairs that would ensue based off a complete ridding of the MW. By increasing it were inflating the dollar and thus not actually paying our workers more for what they already do. Based off that statement alone we can infer the offered pay of jobs what that position is worth. Flipping burgers at a McDonalds is not worth as a lot of politicians might make it out to be. Its a job that is easily replaceable by automation. As previously stated by increasing the wages of lower tier workers were not helping them. The dollar is being inflated and so is worth less. They essentially have what they already have. Just in biggeryet proportional numbers. Furthermore our businesses will be the most affected by the increase of the MW. Having to pay more for a worker for doing the same job from before is a terrible business move. They will have to lay off more workers in order to compensate for their deficit just based off labor cost.

For an act to be moral doesnt just mean that it is permissible according to ethics but you need to actually know that it is moral.Most people dont understand the issue well enough to know abortion is moral. In fact most or at least a large proportion of people dont know much of anything. For example only of people dont believe that global warming is caused by human activity. Only of people in the US believe in evolution of registered voters believe Obama is a Muslim Of those a large percent probably only say that they believe in evolution or global warming because their friends do. If their friends said the opposite then theyd probably think that the scientists were just making it up too.So thats on scientific issues that are relatively clear cut. Philosophical issues are much more messy. What percentage of people male and female do you believe actually understand the issue and arent just quoting whatever theyve heard other people say?From the way that these discussions go it seems to be very small. Lots of people identify viability as the point where a foetus deserves moral consideration but they cant articulate a reason why theoretical ability of foetus to survive outside of a womb should be connected to metaphysical rights indeed this is a weak argument philosophically.Many people try to construct a right of bodily autonomy but the situations differ in the important respect that the mother knowing put themselves in a position where there was a risk of pregnancy. Because of this distinction bodily autonomy doesnt work as a contradiction argument only as an analogy to aid intuition.Now while there are strong philosophically justified utilitarian grounds and other more nuanced arguments within other moral frameworks I would be surprised if more than of the population could provide a logically coherent argument. To be clear Im sure that many of the people here can restructure these arguments to be much more logically coherent except that isnt really the point here the point is that most people are logically incoherent.Objection Does any of this matter? If someone does something that is morally acceptable and they believe that it is morally acceptable then arent they in the clear?Not quite. Someone has to also take due diligence. Suppose someone who believes in utilitarian ethics is going to go back in time and kill Hitler. This will have a good result it will save millions of lives and they strongly believe this. But before they get a chance they run into another timetraveller with an oracle machine that can tell them if their action is good or bad perhaps another leader will take over who kills even more than Hitler. If they choose to put their hands in their ears and not listen to the oracle their act to kill Hitler cannot be considered moral because they were gambling with millions of lives by changing the course of world history and ignoring evidence that might have shown it disastrous. This applies even if the result is that they save millions of lives. The point is that for an action to be moral it isnt sufficient for it to be morally acceptable and for the person to believe that it is morally acceptable but one needs to also take an appropriate level of care when coming to that decision.In the same way human life is hugely valuable and someone who has an abortion without making a rather significant effort to ensure that they understand the issue is acting immorally as they are not taking the appropriate level of care.Most people if they were truly honest would have to admit that they dont really understand the issue and therefore cannot be justified in having an abortion without knowing that they have solid arguments to support their position.Change my view.'},\n {'id': 't3_2eez7x',\n  'titles': 'Romantic relationships in high school are not worth the trouble',\n  'argument': 'When someone is in high school it does not make sense to have a committed romantic relationship.

To me activehelpful bystander henceforth known as active bystander mentality is an irresponsible teaching because it is dangerous relieves the school of a lot of responsibility and weakens the success rate of stopping bullying.Being an active bystander is dangerous because it redirects the flow of aggression from the previous victim to the person who decided to intervene. The aggression could be anything from just hateful words being thrown to something as severe as a lifeendingcrippling weapon being pointed at the new defender not necessarily a gun maybe a knife or something else. It forces the defender to cover both himherself as well as the initial victim. On top of this if there are other bystanders who choose to be harmful harmful bystanders now the defender has to defend against or more people. This on top of the fact that the victim may or may not be helpful in the repelling of the bully helps to ensure that from a safety point being an active bystander is not the best idea.Active bystanders also remove much of the burden from the school. When schools essentially appoint everyone as a militia against bullying it rids itself of much of the duty to detect bullying as it happens. As I mentioned earlier active bystanders themselves may not be powerful enough to even stop the threat. Without the cooperation of the school overall people will have a much weaker antibullying effort. If a fight actually takes place the school can just shrug it off by enforcing zeropolicy and suspend both the active bystander. This doesnt even solve the problem for a few reasons. The bully either a didnt mean what they saiddid and just had their emotions get in the way therefore feeling like they were unfairly treated or b dont care about school or their peers and do this for whatever reason they want to. For the defender well they just got rekt due to their fail at bullying and from the victims perspective they probably feel cheated for getting punished for something they could not control.My view could be changed if someone could find a better solution that repels the bully nulls the aggression and gives the schools some responsibility.Please convince me if I got something wrong about my logic.'},\n {'id': 't3_2ebkiy',\n  'titles': 'With regards to sandwiches triangular cuts are far superior to rectangular cuts and should be the only ones ever used.',\n  'argument': 'With regards to sandwiches triangular cuts are far superior to rectangular cuts and should be the only ones ever used. Every time I use sliced bread I end up cutting it triangularly. Toast sandwiches grilled cheese etc. I think it is the best way and that sandwiches on traditional sliced bread should be cut this way. So Im not referring to subsetc. I will also allow patti melts as an exception although I prefer them cut still. My boyfriend barely ever slices sandwiches when he cooks and when he does he tends to go with rectangular. Most likely to spite me because I cant think of any reason to ever use that style of cutting. So my views are that sandwiches should always be sliced and they should be sliced in a triangular fashion from corner to corner with the above noted exceptions and specifications. First a sliced sandwich is always superior to one that has not been sliced. It allows you direct access to the middle where the most flavor is. It also cuts down on the amount of crumbs created. You are also able to completely avoid eating the crust this way if you prefer. Second the triangular slice is always superior to the rectangular slice. If you have a dipping sandwich such as grilled cheese with tomato soup the triangular shape allows you to fit the sandwich into a container much easier since you have a smaller tip. They also fit around a bowl much easier as triangles. can also regulate how much of the sandwich you bit off easier. You can see much more of the insides of the sandwich to inspect where you might want to bite. The triangle is a stronger shape than a rectangle so you can support the sandwich with less effort. When you eat the insides of the sandwich the triangle leaves a much more manageable crust than the rectangular cuts. uNepene gets a delta for convincing me that rectangle cut is superior in ONLY ONE WAY when transporting in ziplock baggies.

It seems to require much less thought and effort than actually coming up with a way to bring the song to a close and its highly unsatisfying to me.The fade out is usually during several repetitions of the chorus which in and of itself seems like lazy songwriting. If the song has said all it has to say repeating the chorus over and over again isnt going to improve or enhance it at all. Its just filler and I suspect thats often how its used to flesh out a song enough to make it long enough to play on the radio.

Okay I think this book is long enough. Ill just throw in some ellipses and...done! People are probably tired of this play by now lets just close the curtains and dim the lights.

Input from recording artists or producers that have decided to end a song this way and their reasoning behind it. Note that these reasons should be musical because it actually made the song better and not for marketing time constraints or other purposes. Fades work as a transition in the context of an album or longer piece of music. Musical endings are no more difficult to pull off than fades. Fades can contribute to a feeling of endlessness which is sometimes appropriate to the theme or tone of the song.

Police in England are warning that it may be illegal to download or distribute this video.I dont think its too hard to understand my view. ISIS created a video which required irreversible harm to someone in order to create. They arent interested in making a monetary profit theyre interested in spreading their message to people. When you view the video youre showing them that there is demand for more of this content and theyve demonstrated theyre willing to kill more prisoners. The family of James Foley has gone on the record requesting that people dont view the video out of respect for James.Child pornography can be created for a few different reasons. A large amount of child pornography is created not for profit but simply to exchange with others. These videos and images may require irreversible harm in their creation and by downloading and viewing them you are creating a demand for further production of that content. I would imagine that given the choice the victims of child pornography and their families would give the same plea that the Foley family did to avoid watching or spreading the video.Its interesting to me that everyone in the rworldnews thread thought it was completely absurd to make viewing the execution illegal while Im fairly sure none of them would want to legalize free child pornography. Im not advocating that either of these things should be legal or illegal Im just having a hard time understanding why they occupy such a different legal space in much of the world. One argument I forsee is that many people are downloading the Foley video out of a morbid curiosity while people who download child pornography are doing so to enjoy the content. Whether or not I enjoy content is of little concern. The fact remains that if I enjoy child pornography I would continue to view it again and if I had the morbid curiosity to view an execution I would likely have that same urge the next chance I got.

We see this system used in many things like in tv shows. The Voice for example I think that this is a wonderful and fair system which works well when all voters have sufficient skill to judge candidates. In The Voice the audience is adequately equipped to decide who is the best singer. People are fully capable of voting on things like their favorite ice cream or their favorite tv show.This system breaks down when the voters do not have the necessary skills or knowledge to make a proper judgement. Take for example a boxing match. Many matches go to the judges and most members of the audience do not have boxing experience. If the audience were allowed to vote for the winner it would often result in the winner being chosen via a popularity contest rather than by the rules of the ring. Most people watching a match would not be able to give an accurate judgement of the match simply because their seat in the stadium or their seat in front of a tv does not permit them to reliably count the number of clean punches.Lets take another example Net Neutrality. Most people probably spent minutes reading an article by someone who spent minutes googling the subject before writing. And now they think they know everything there is to know. The Net Neutrality documents are hundreds of pages and would take weeks to read through and analyze. Industry experience would be a requirement in making a proper decision. See the danger of letting the average person cast a vote?Finally lets address the voting of political candidates. Each candidate represents an allegiance to a bundle of different policies which represents thousands of pages of documents which can represent years of reading and analysis. Understandably citizens are not allowed to vote on individual policies.The only alternative to an equal weight system is to weigh the votes differently. I believe that each person should have a number of votes equal to the amount of federal taxes paid for the previous year or some variation like average of past years.This would be the effects Any attempt for the wealthy to reduce their taxes will result in destroying their own voting power. This is key and many people dont get this. The system is self correcting in that you cannot choose to not pay tax and also control the government at the same time. You would get a vote size proportional to your contribution to society. It seems rather fair that you should have a bigger say of what to do with the money if you contribute more. There is a high correlation between intelligence and income. Weighing votes this way would help to put more voting power into the hands of people who are more likely to make better decisions. Well finally be able to have smart politicians instead of popular politicians in office. From what Ive seen the smartest politicians who can actually address issues are not popular.

For example many feel that the Americas FPTP system is to blame as it reduces electoral competition as per Duvergers law. Others feel that a more powerful criticism is that singlemember districts allow legislators to engage in partisan gerrymandering diluting the voter strength of the opposition party. Some blame draconinan Voter ID laws meant to disenfranchise certain demographic groups. Some blame Americas campaign finance system asserting that unrestricted donations from individuals and corporations corrupts the system and makes legislators beholden to their donors and backers rather than to their constituents. Some assert that the aforementioned problems are compounded by issues in the political economy neoliberal economic policies that allowed the rich to take a higher share of national income and wealth enabled them to game the political system in their favor. Moreover many political scientists look at how governance is affected by both actors and institutions. The institutional design of the U.S. federal government necessities compromise however when the political parties are unwilling to work together as is the case now the gears of government grind to a halt. As per the conditional party government theory when the parties are internally homogeneous and polarized efficiency increases in the House due to positive and negative gatekeeping by the Speaker but efficiency is worsened in the Senate due to the filibuster unless one party has members. As a result during periods of divided government little gets done. Furthermore the constitutional design of the U.S. and the system of federalism could lead to political dysfunction. While all of these are arguably problems depending on your viewpoint I feel that above all else the main problem is a dangerously illinformed populace. Most voters dont have any meaningful knowledge of American history world history political theory knowing about the principles upon which America is based economics business science sociology foreign policy etc. Im not saying that its practical or expected for people to become experts in all of these fields but they need some basic knowledge so that they can think for themselves to some degree. Moreover people dont spend enough time critically thinking about the various issues in politics both issues that affect them personally and issues that affect America at large and dont adequately analyze the positions of the candidates. Furthermore people are so illinformed that they fail to even apply basic mathematics to real world issues. As a result they fall for all sorts of hilariously misguided policies and mathematically impossible schemes.Theres a concept in politics called words which is if you cant simplify a policy issue in words or less your audience wont get it. Most issues are extremely complex involving multiple sides all with gains and losses and the majority of the audience are extremely incapable of truly grasping them. Voters often use heuristics to determine their vote as a result the are easily manipulated by pundits whom voters believe to knowledgeable. Because of low information voters politicians have an incentive to pander the lowest common denominator and to appeal to peoples fears and emotions. Consequently voters dont choose the best candidate. They chooses the candidate who promises the most and best things regardless of whether the candidate can actually get these things done and uses flashy vacuous feelgood psuedoinspirational political rhetoric compare this to Britain where candidates focus more on concrete policy and use facts and figures in their debates.Politicians focus more on rhetoric appealing to pathos rather than formulating concrete policy to the nations problems. Since people are so vulnerable to manipulation politicians can convince voters to vote against their interests and make them genuinely believe lies including the belief that manmade climate change isnt a real thing and that cutting taxes on the very wealthy aka job creators will trickle down to the poorest worker. The reason why politicians care more about serving special interests is because politicians would rather impose diffuse costs on voters at large while providing specific benefits to politically engaged special interest groups RATHER than providing diffuse benefits to voters a politically disengaged group and providing specific costs to special interests. After all politicians can later delude their constituents into thinking that their evisceration of energy efficiency standards actually helps voters by creating more jobs or something. People often blame SuperPACS and the Koch brothers etc for rigging the electoral system. But ultimately what they are doing is airing ads sending leaflets disseminating their views on the internet doing marketing campaigns etc. Its not as if the Koch brothers are literally forcing the viewers of their ads to vote for particular candidates. Voters still do have the final say in whom they vote for.If people became more genuinely educated and aware about these issues they would be able to think for themselves and would be better able to critique the positions of political candidates and resist the propaganda spewed by pundits and candidates and their campaigns. If people actually exercised their voting right in a meaningful manner politicians would be less beholden to special interests and would have an incentive to pursue policies actually in line with the genuine views of their constituents. Moreover voters would pick higher quality candidates who instead of focusing all their time trying to fundraise from special interests and deluding voters would focus on legislating policy to deal with Americas genuine issues climate change education etc.'},\n {'id': 't3_2e1fah',\n  'titles': 'By raising a family in the suburbs the parents are condemning the children to boredom dependence inactivity and expense.',\n  'argument': 'I believe that the suburbs are a worse environment to raise children in than either more rural areas or more urbanized areas generally speaking. Im aware there was a on this subject not too long ago However theres a few points I feel werent made there. Ill try to avoid treading over the same ground.For one my idea of an urban area is one where most amenities are in range of walking biking or a relatively short bus ride. This includes schools shops parks etc. This was brought up in the past AMA but the discussion didnt really include a comparison of accessibility. Cities can generally be navigated without a car because they usually preceded the car. Suburbs on the other hand were designed explicitly around cars the feasibility of walking wasnt taken into consideration by planners developers or business owners when placing public spaces and private businesses.This critical distinction means that while suburbs may have shops parks libraries and of course schools children are completely dependent on their parents for access. This is not conducive to raising kids with an independent mindset. Where the urban year old who wants to play soccer see his friends or buy an icecream cone can simply get up and go the suburban kid has to ask her parents who then have to agree to take time out of their day to drive her down. Furthermore the urban kid would get passive exercise if he walked or biked to where he was going the suburban kid rarely has that option for reasons of distance or safety. When she turns the suburban kid does have the option of getting a car. However this means thousands of dollars have to be dedicated to getting the independence and freedom that the urban kid has already had for years. The urban yearold is more likely to spend money from a job on something other than basic transportation.These criticisms also all apply to rural areas but those have one critical offset access to space. My childhood was spent between rural western Washington state and rural eastern Oregon. In both cases though my neighborhoods might have resembled suburbs there was a lot of undeveloped unfenced land around. My friends might have had to be dropped off by their parents but once they were there we went exploring in the woods or desert built forts rode bikes played war. When I got older we could play paintball. Other kids in the neighborhood rode dirt bikes. Though we didnt have access to ball fields or libraries in walking distance we did have the forest W Washington or desert E Oregon as a playground. Other rural kids that I have known have learned to build small structures raised livestock or learned target shooting.In short the design of the suburbs makes it almost impossible to get around without a car. This prevents children who grow up there from developing independent problemsolving abilities that their urban and rural peers will develop. They will be less likely to exercise because more barriers are thrown into their way. When they get to driving age they will most likely take a parttime job and dedicate most of its proceeds to getting the mobility their urban peers take for granted. Parents who choose a house in the suburbs over a house within city limits are saddling their children with dependence inactivity and expense.

Cops are not secretly serial killers who are just waiting for a chance to get away with killing someone. But thats how these morons are portraying the police. I refuse to believe that a member of the police performed a public execution under scrutiny of other bystanders. The cop isnt mentally ill. His actions must done alongside of some kind of self interest. Shoot an innocent person who poses no danger in the head execution style in public? Really? What possibly way of reasoning could lead to that conclusion? I was confident since the very break of the news that the cop was unlikely to have done anything wrong. These protesters automatically assumed the cop was in the wrong and refused to acknowledge new evidence.I get pissed off that people think Michael Brown is still a saint after the video of him robbing the store was released. Retards insist that it has nothing to do with the shooting. It has everything to do with it. The reality is that Michael probably thought he got caught and therefore his interactions with the cop was likely to be extremely aggressive. I imagine it went something likeOfficer Hey youre blocking trafficMichael I aint rob no store you fucking pig.Officer I didnt say...Michael These cigars aint from the store.Officer I didnt ask about....Michael Fuck all ya.

Also I am referring to accepting money for scholarships not scholarships that were established in the past and are simply continuing to run on investments.Prior to the past or so years there was a massive gender gap in university. This gap was due to stigma against women and the status quo that existed at that time. Scholarships were very important to encourage females to attend university. Likewise racial minorities were greatly misrepresented. However I believe that now they are not only not needed but they provide an unfair bias towards specific people.In recent surveys in Canada the US the UK and Australia there is an relatively equal ratio of male to female at universities with the average usually leaning towards male to female. In addition the increase in female intake results in an even bigger increase in the gap. Now there is still a gap between male and females in physical sciences maths and engineering ranging between relatively small malefemale to quite large . While this may be an issue I do not believe scholarships are a way to solve it as they have been continuously offered and yet the gap is increasing still in some cases. I believe that the way to solve it would be for a greater push for opportunities in high school perhaps.Similarly race is nowhere near the issue it was in the past. Virtually all major universities are quite culturally diverse and wish to take in the best students regardless of race. In addition due to immigration in the past there are students who can gain major scholarships despite being quite removed from their racial background as an example I knew someone who got a major scholarship for being of Korean descent despite the fact that his parents left when they were young and he had never visited.All in all I believe it is discrimination that someone is restricted from certain financial aid for the sole reason of their birth. Receiving a scholarship no longer is due to being very good at what you do compared to everyone but rather only compared to people of a specific small group. Now it is possible that people of certain areas may have received less education or support but I believe aid for those people should be given based upon circumstance rather than gender or race. In addition such scholarships lead to confusion regarding certain parties for example is a intersex or a transgender person male or female? In the end I believe that such scholarships should be offered to everyone with equal opportunities.Changed views Realistic implementation As people have pointed out to me it is much harder to implement such a view without marginalizing minorities than I thought. I concede that though I may disagree with it on principle it is still near impossible to change in the near future. Imbalance in some locations Some people have pointed out that I have made some major assumptions and that there is still major racism and sexism in many locations. Perhaps as a nonAmerican in a very culturally diverse location I have a much different experience than most of Reddit I go to school where whites are the minority and work at a university that is Indian and Asian. I tried to do as much research as possible but obviously personal experience in this case is something I dont have.Maintained views Ideological belief This is something that I feel has perhaps been reaffirmed by the constant statement that It might work in theory but never in practice. I still hold the belief that in a vacuum scholarships should be merit based and that they should be available for people of all race and sex. Belief that certain issues are better addressed through other means People have brought up that white males have an advantage in terms of opportunities that exceeds the few scholarships of race. Where I live I have never experienced that in fact in general the white population is actually poorer than many other races. However assuming in such a case I believe that aid should be given based upon economic situations rather than race. There can very well be white males in poor circumstances with limited education just like there can for anyone else. Money should not be donated to a sexistracist cause Not saying that this is one but some people have made the point that people should be able to do whatever they want with it. I disagree still and believe that it should not be allowed to support hateful causes.Notes First and foremost as mentioned above I am not American and this has led to some confusion on both parties. Laws seem to be different in the States than where I live we are not allowed to give money to racist sexist or hateful things. Similarly we do not have legacy or athletic scholarships and you cant get into university simply because you are rich. Some people have brought up that it is unfair to ban affirmative action and allow these scholarships. If it was my decision I would ban those as well and make scholarships completely need based or merit based independent of anything else. I am aware that the amount of scholarships available to people of race only is minimal this is more about the concept and belief rather than actual financial aid given out. In my experience it is not rare to have major scholarships available only to people of race where I live but like I said it may be different elsewhere. Most importantly I hope I am not coming across as racist or sexist. Often when these discussions come up people seem to take a very polarized opinion. While I do not agree with some views I can understand almost all of them. Personally I am someone who believes in equal opportunities for people of all races classes and sexes.'},\n {'id': 't3_2dz34k',\n  'titles': 'The release of the CCTV footage of Michael Brown is not character assassination but a vital component of the incident that helps all parties understand the context of the shooting and the state of mind of the individuals involved.',\n  'argument': 'First off let me clarify I am not defending the actions of Ferguson Police Officer Darren Wilson. I believe that he did use excessive force and the shooting should be thoroughly investigated. This post is not to debate over whether or not Officer Wilson needs to be tried or whether the Ferguson Police is an example of police militarisation in the US. This post is solely to look at the decision to release the CCTV footage of Michael Brown robbing a convenience store.Now that thats out of the way I dont really understand why everyone was so angry at the release of the CCTV footage showing what appears to be Michael Brown robbing a convenience store. I see in multiple news sources where people have stated that the footage appeared to cast aspersions on the dead man or is a form of character assassination. Finding out that the shooting victim had just returned from robbing a store is critical information because it provides context for the fact that a police officer confronted him over something minor and unrelated like obstructing the street and a violent altercation took place soon after. I see family members and other people saying that he wasnt perfect but it seems to me that theyre dismissing the fact that he had just committed a crime. The police officer may not have known of Michael Browns actions but it makes sense that Michael Brown would be more onedge scared and impulsive after committing a crime and encountering a police officer so soon after. Thus this footage provides a critical perspective into Michael Browns state of mind and his subsequent mannerismsbehavior might have alerted Officer Wilson and escalated the encounter.My view is that the CCTV footage was essential information that needed to be provided to the public. While it may have been misconstrued as character assassination the footage is an invaluable part of the story that helps explain the context and actions of both Officer Wilson and Michael Brown.'},\n {'id': 't3_2dy3mw',\n  'titles': 'Tupac Shakur was a violent rapist who glorified gang culture in his music and never lived up to the peace loving messenger image hes developed today.',\n  'argument': 'For every song with a positive message like Keep ya head up or Changes hes got more that glorify gang violence and shootings.

I am specifically arguing this from a perspective of US law.There are various things that disqualify people from being allowed to purchase or possess firearms or ammunition. These generally include sometimes depending on state being involuntarily committed to a mental institution being the target of a restraining order being adjudicated by a court to be mentally unfit to stand trial being convicted of a violent misdemeanor or a domestic violence crime and being convicted of a felony.Most people seem to be perfectly happy with prohibiting some people from possessing firearms based on their history convictions mental illness etc. I believe we should be very careful with who we remove constitutionally protected rights from but I am ok with removing firearm rights through due process of law in most of the cases where we do under current law.My question is why do we not remove the privilege of people to possess and consume alcohol under certain circumstances? This isnt a constitutionally protected right and removal of that freedom would be done with due process anyway so there is no particular reason why we cannot do it.We should create a list of offenses that disqualify a person from being allowed to possess or consume alcohol. That list should include people with a DUI conviction that resulted in injury or death to an innocent person with a felony DUI conviction multiple DUIs in a short period DUI while on a suspended license etc people with a domestic violence or child endangerment conviction that was alcohol related and perhaps even people who have been involuntarily committed to a mental institution with suicidal tendencies.Alcohol consumption seems to increase risk of suicide in people who are already very depressed or suicidal it seems to increase the likelihood of domestic violence and child abuse and it definitely increases the risk of DUI in people with prior DUI convictions.In fact I have a friend with DUIs over a period of less than years while driving on a suspended license and yet they still eventually gave him his license back and he still drinks regularly and sometimes drives while under the influence. I think that is appalling just because he hasnt hurt anyone yet doesnt mean he should be allowed to keep drinking and driving until someone gets killed. His ability to legally possess and consume alcohol is a danger to society and simply suspending his license again isnt good enough he will still drive illegally even without a license.Here is how I would implement it. I think it is too much of a burden to require all bars and liquor stores to call up a system and run a background check on every patron like the current NICS system for firearms. Instead I propose that people who are deemed to be prohibited persons should have a special mark placed on their drivers license or ID which would indicate that they are prohibited. Bar tenders and liquor store employees would need to check everyones ID not just people who appear to be under age and would be required to refuse to sell alcohol to anyone with that mark on their license.Obviously that wont stop them from paying a homeless person to buy them alcohol like teenagers do so we also need strict penalties for prohibited persons who are caught with any alcohol in their blood or in their possession and even stricter penalties if they are caught committing any sort of crime while under the influence such as DUI domestic violence etc.This post was prompted by this thread but has also been something Ive been thinking about for a long timeTLDR Just like some people are deemed by society to be too irresponsible to be allowed to possess firearms due to criminal activity or mental illness some people potentially for different reasons should be deemed by society to be too irresponsible to be allowed to possess or consume alcohol and it should be a criminal offense for a prohibited person to possess or consume alcohol.'},\n {'id': 't3_2dwo4u',\n  'titles': 'I think that bringing up rights when discussing policy is unproductive.',\n  'argument': 'Im not a fan of the way policy discussion takes place and feel it could be more productive.Let us start off with abortion. I am completely pro choice but I dont like the way discussion in some cases takes place. For example I saw a post on two x that didnt really refute any restrictive abortion policies but just stated the right to bodily autonomy as an argument against them. I dont feel like stating that is a proper refutation. I think that if we were to look at something like sex selective abortion policies it might be more obvious what I see is wrong with those arguments. Imagine if they were having a debate in India. One person brings up all this data about the problems with unrestricted sex selective abortion and the other person simply said that those policies shouldnt be allowed because it was their right to an abortion for whatever reason they wish. This would be bad because the discussion is far too nuanced.I think that there are problems that arise from hiding behind this argument. The fundamental reason I would consider it bad is this. Rights are a human construct. A bunch of people got together and decided that guaranteeing certain rights would be best for the people. It seems perfectly reasonable that they couldve been wrong and that guaranteeing those rights in certain situation are bad. Not trying to suggest whether or not they are. They could be though so arguing that something shouldnt happen because it is your right is a terrible argument.Im not trying to suggest all discussion that takes place is like this. When talking about gun rights there is a lot of fruitful and important discussion using data statistics and other relevant factors. However there is a small group of arguers who would refute arguments from the other side by simply saying that it is their right guaranteed by the second amendment.I think that rights are not relevant in policy discussion.'},\n {'id': 't3_2dw5ig',\n  'titles': 'If I am going at or above the speed limit and you are wanting to pass me the burden is on you to move over to a different lane to pass me not on myself.',\n  'argument': 'Heres the thing.

Im not advocating for the abolition of the age of consent. I accept that the power differential and the immaturity of the younger person makes it problematic at the very least.Yet all the same I think its a great false equivalency to consider it to be a similar magnitude offense to being held down and raped. The primary reason I believe this and admittedly its based on little more than intuition is that I feel that victims of the respective crimes tend to feel much differently in hindsight. From what Ive read forcible rape victims often find the experience highly traumatic and suffer longterm psychological problems. Virtually all would agree that the experience was a huge negative. But I think if you were to poll a group of statutory rape victims years later when they were more mature you would get a much more diverse range of responses. Some would have no regrets and do the same thing over again some would regret it but chalk it up as a silly youthful mistake and others would blame it for a lot of their current problems. Probably the breakdown wouldnt look too different from polling them about any relationship theyd had while young.What would it take to change my view? Probably strong empirical evidence that statutory rape victims do by and large suffer significantly. I see that kind of thing asserted a lot but I kind of wonder if its a bit of justso story.

Instead I simply dont believe that automation will take off on the widespread scale that some people are speculating. In this Youtube video Humans Need Not Apply the narrator believes that all jobs not just simple manufacturing jobs will be replaced by robots. He relates our perils to that of the early th century horse that was replaced by the automobile. But I think this comparison is crude and does not take into the account of economics. Lets say his vision comes to fruition and the people with unskilled jobs are given the boot. And for the sake of generalization lets also assume that the number of people receiving minimum wage is roughly similar to the number of unskilled laborers in the US if you dont agree with this generalization I apologize. According the study from the Bureau of Labor Statistics . million people work for minimum wage salary which represents almost the number of salaried workers in the US. So back to the matter at hand. Lets say that they are let go from their jobs due to the fact that automation would be cheaper for business owners. We now have roughly million people out of jobs. Yup Id say that would put us in the very least a recession or possibly a depression. These million people would be unable to acquire the skills necessary to be hirable in the dwindling workforce due to a lack of money to receive an education.So now lets assume that these million people without jobs will go into a super saving mode in order to be able to buy food and keep whatever shelter they have over their heads. I dont think the government will be able to provide substantial welfare to almost half of the work force. According to Labor Market Information the workforce in August of was Americans and the workforce in July of was people. Pretty similar numbers so lets stick with since thats the date of the BLS study. If we add the current unemployed with the newly unemployed due to automation and divide that number by the labor force ... we would get an unemployment rate of . Yikes I doubt the economy is doing great right now with almost of the population unemployed. Even if the robots are cheaper and banging out products day in and day out who is going to buy the merchandise? The United States GDP would be in crumbles! Businesses would go out of business due to a lack of cash flow and even more people would be unemployed. It would be a nasty cycle that would keep pushing more and more people out of jobs and onto the streets.Now I think that the only way this level of automation would work is if our society converted into completely socialist society and shared the wealth and products of the robots equally. But I simply dont see that happening. It would be possibly the largest undertaking by the Government ever to create a working and efficient socialist system based purely on handouts. Plus I cant ever see the government allowing automation to take away the jobs of so many Americans. When Tesla began to put pressure on regular auto dealers because of their superior product New Jersey Texas Colorado Arizona and Virginia all prohibited the sale of Teslas in their states. If those states will go to those measures to protect car dealers I would bet money that the Federal Government would do a good deal to protect the jobs of of the workforce.I simply dont think that automation will change our lives as radically as the folks at rfuturology would like you to believe. Sure automation will come into effect in the future but I dont think that it will be the problem that some have been making it out to be.

They typically use ineffective sodium vapor lights. While sodium vapor lights are highly efficient technically speaking they produce yellow or orangish light far outside of our eyes peak sensitivity which is in the bluegreen region. So despite their efficiency they need much more power to provide good visibility than many other sources of light like fluorescent tubes. Even when the lights are replaced with modern LED lights most places opt for higher brightness instead of reduced power consumption. They are usually bright enough to disable night vision yet often not consistently bright enough for good day vision. This often makes it harder to see than with no artificial lighting at all especially if there are large gaps between the lights. While the eyes readapt faster from such relatively low intensity light there is still a period of a few minutes when you are effectively blind. I would not be surprised if it was a major cause of accidents. Many lampposts are designed and placed in such a way that its impossible to not look directly into the light which makes the above even worse.Instead if public lighting is to be provided at all it should be either cyan or white light limited to at most moonlight levels with possible exceptions for important signs and such and similar restrictions imposed on other sources of light like shop windows.

Coming from a very competitive environment I have definitely become used to the stresses associated with comparing myself to others. While I do not think it is the best for my mental health I do think it gives me a massive edge over others. I say this because when you compare yourself it allows you to see where you stand against others and can cue a desire to improve. Furthermore I think the argument of we are all unique people so why compare is a way to justify our desire not to work for the results. This view allows us to be content with our flaws and gives us the cue that we cant achieve those goals that others have achieved when. I honestly believe that if I stop comparing myself to people I will lose the edge in my career path music and will not be viewed as serious. Ultimately people who do not compare themselves are not being realistic and are hiding from reality. In the real world we are always compared against other people and this is how we grow against others. If I was to stop comparing myself then I would not be able to see where I stand in the real world and thus would have a distorted view of reality.

If you need to be on welfare because you cant afford food or housing then you should not be able to have children you wont be able to afford to feed and care for. Too many people in my area and Im sure across the country are living off welfare that was meant to be used as a temporary helping hand to get people on their feet. If you end up pregnant you either abort give it up for adoption or get taken off welfare. well after reading all your points I wish to change some of my viewpoint. I am all for the people who get fired or laid off being able to get assistance and I wouldnt want to see anyones kids actually taken away so for those who asked about working mothers losing there jobs no they should definitely be able to keep their children. same goes for if they are pregnant when they apply. my biggest problem with the welfare system is when I see families with kids a PS putting big stereos in their new cars still collecting welfare and living that way for years. things like unemployment you are suppose to be looking for a job using the money till you get one. if your testing positive for the harder drugs chances are your not going to get a job seeing as most jobs drug check now. Thanks to KevinWestern about of my viewpoint has changed.

The U.S. cant defeat IS without enormous and unacceptable civilian casualties. IS is going to win.',\n  'argument': 'This is part view part prediction. So its certainly fallible and i hope to be proven wrong in the near future.Id like for IS to be destroyed but i think thats an unrealistic expectation.This is a decent look at IS.They are well integrated into the areas they have captured. They are not universally hated by the surrounding civilians. They are not treating all civilians like prisoners or slaves or hostages. They have plenty of members recruits and sympathizers across enormous amounts of land.My view is that Civilian Blending is an unstoppable strategy designed to survive intervention from nations like the U.S.No individual country that respects or is bound by international law can defeat this strategy.Civilian Blending When a militant or terrorist group embeds into a civilian population in order to protect themselves from formal military retaliation. With successful use of this tactic there is minimal distinction visual or otherwise between the militants and the civilian people and infrastructure. its all shared space. militants are often near children and innocent civilians and live within the cities among the people.Goal To become as indistinguishable as possible from the civilian population to minimize the effectiveness of airstrikes and long range attacks.Tactics Dont wear uniforms store weapons in civilian areas such as Mosques Hospitals Schools vital infrastructure etc. Use residential civilian infrastructure like apartment buildings for militant activity use mass local propaganda and law enforcement to keep the civilians from fleeing recruit willing civilian martyrs encourage civilians to hide and assist militants for money use the inevitable civilian deaths to recruit more militants from the local population etc.Outcome Accurate recon becomes incredibly difficult and highly susceptible to errors. High civilian to militant death toll is inevitable in all types of operations. Major mistakes will also happen that result in mass civilian deaths. Extremely high value targets will be impossible to kill without killing innocent people in Mosques churches schools power plants water treatment plants and other vital infrastructure protected by international laws.This will leave the U.S. with very limited options...Option Contain them. Full victory is impossible without mass civilian deaths and breaking international laws. Let IS have what land they have already taken. Perhaps liberate small towns that overwhelmingly want to be liberated. Contain them and get into a prolonged conflicts along their borders. targeted airstrikes while we arm their neighbors to keep them from spreading.Option Fight them. Accept the civilian deaths. Eventually be stopped by the International community and accused of war crimes.The civilian blending tactic ensures that the international community will start to see warcrimes against civilians. Prolonged asymmetric warfare tends to makes the powerful side into the bad guy. The weak side just has to survive because it cant win. The US will kill innocent civilians in numerous ways by accident on purpose as acceptable losses and by killing the willing martyrs. Thats just war but it wont be accepted and the US will be condemned for each death deemed by the world as avoidable. There will be antiUS protests across the world. The media will begin to frame this as US vs innocent civilians. America will have to reexplain itself over and over. Why are you still there why isnt IS defeated yet? why did you bomb that school? Why is the civilian death count so high? Didnt we go in there to protect these people? But instead we bomb their kids?! The body count will be reported as IraqisSyrians dead mostly civilians US dead all soldiers. and people will discuss how evil the US is more and more every day. People will say If some invading force was on my land id shoot them too why is the US over there anyways? The civilian body count will be in the thousands or tens of thousands because this terrorist tactic works extremely well. People will quickly forget why the US is fighting in Iraq and accuse the US of indiscriminately targeting civilians. The US will be called on by the UN to explain why the civilian body count is so high. IS will wait patiently laughing its ass off because the big dumb animal fell into the trap AGAIN... The US will pull out because of the international and internal political pressure. IS will have an enormous recruiting tool from having survived a war against the US. Genocide land grabs sharia law ethnic cleansing suicide bombing assassinations kidnappings general violence and evil begins anew in Iraq and the US is called for to intervene.But maybe im wrong.Maybe this is what brings peace to that region.But personally i think IS hasis going to win.

And that its not always a bad thing after ten nights of no sleep a parent cant be expected to make the best decisions.Except there should be better alternatives to just the shiny glowing box.

This was clearly the goal of the advertisements but I believe that this technique should be used to teach children good things not ingrain worthless information in their brains for all eternity.My example as a kid of the s is that fucking Sears commercial.

The more awareness for what it is the better.I have a few viewpoints on this subject that I would like to get out there because its been bothering me.Little background Ive never been clinically diagnosed Ill get to why later but for the first years of college something weird happened. I went from having great grades in high school and a lot of friends to finding myself literally holing up in my dorm room every night and every weekend. I gained roughly pounds over those years and I was failing all my classes. I wasnt even able to muster the effort to put the work in. Also I distinctly remember having suicidal thoughts. I never actually thought I would go through with any of them but it occupied my mind quite a bit. I wanted to change. I desperately tried. But nothing was clicking. I definitely read a little bit into depression during this time and I figured that I had some minor variant of it. I wanted to reach out and talk to someone but I figured that I could handle it on my own. I read a lot into depression and overcoming it and I knew that exercise and a better diet would help but I still wasnt able to do any of that. Like I couldnt get myself to do what I know I needed to do. It pissed me off. I blamed myself for that and I still do. So heres where it gets interesting and heres where I hope some of you can shed light on this topic. This was almost years ago so Im forgetting exactly where the shift happened but the summer after my nd year I started reading a lot into Zen Buddhism and Stoicism and this COMPLETELY changed my view on the world and my life. What I realized was that my thoughts are in my head obviously and that I can be in control of them. I realized that I was putting positives and negatives into certain situations when the situation is neutral by default. The big thing for me was realizing that the world isnt mean or nice its indifferent. It literally gives no fucking shits about any of us. So I think what happened to me was that I had an expectation of reality that was different from reality itself. I believe this caused my year downward spiral to a point where I was an utter failure friendless and alone. This was definitely a ramble but I hope it made some sense. Im at a point in my life now where Im having a hard time remembering EXACTLY how I felt during that period but I definitely remember that I would sometimes cry in the shower and do other things of that nature. I was literally alone for days straight. I would just wake up and sit in my room the entire day. I would ask for extensions and still not be able to muster up any assignments.At the time I saw that as a character flaw and now I still see it as a character flaw. So does this mean that I see depression as a character flaw? I also learned that a lot of people go through similar bouts. Maybe not quite as intense rarely quite so intense...to the point where it is affecting your future but definitely something noticeable. So if I can get through it with reading books and changing my mental attitude why cant everyone else? Why cant we all realize that life isnt fun and games that its indifferent. Our thoughts CAN be controlled. I couldnt control them before but now I can. Its not an overnight process it took me about years to go from that fateful summer of meditation and Stoicism to where I am now. Im at a point now where I can objectively evaluate the things that are going on in my life and even if theyre bad I can handle it.So instead of popping pills and getting electric therapy why dont we medicate people with depression with books and meditation and a MENTAL SHIFT instead of a chemicallyinduced whateverapillis?BTW this same thing applies to anxiety. I went from having crippling anxiety to...still having crippling anxiety but its gotten better. I went from not being able to hold a conversation without panicking sweating almost crying to being able to hold conversations for as long as necessary. Again this all happened without meds. This happened with a mental shift that I induced through books and meditation.I guess Im wondering if someone can explain to me why the goto method is popping pills and therapy when I know for a fact that you can bootstrap your own healing? Im not saying to man up or buck up Im saying to realize that its all in your head and that you dont have to be a slave to it. Meditation and selfhelp books helped me with that a lot.TLDR Pills are unnecessary for depression and anxiety. Theyre just character flaws that can be changed with practice. Obviously this doesnt apply to the fringe cases like Robin Williams or others who commit suicide but definitely applies to the majority of people who claim theyre depressed or anxious.'},\n {'id': 't3_2digbr',\n  'titles': 'Theres no good reason to wear sunscreen unless you work as a lifeguard.',\n  'argument': 'Humans evolved in the sun.

I understand the arguments that the operating systems run more efficiently and that apple is supposed to have better customer service and warranties but do they? Isnt Apple more just forcing you to buy an extended warranty with your product. The old people comment comes from being in the teaching profession and observing that for the same price teenagers today prefer similarly priced Android phones to Iphones. Does this mean that Apple is holding onto their market share because of old ideas of their supremacy in the smart phone market maintained by older people? I dont know maybe.Ill give you some of my background with computers and phones. I grew up using Apple products. My parents always had apples or macintoshes when I was a kid. We had a windows and an IMAC I felt that for the price the Apple products were not worth it especially considering the limited upgradablity which is only used by Apple to make more money. I have always bought windows computers since. I play games on my computer still but rarely ever a game that is very demanding in terms of graphics and processing. I have used both Android phones and Iphones and in my experience the two offer a similar quality.

Darth Vader is also guilty of this routinely killing Imperial officers. So does the Joker in the Dark Knight and this actually almost goes wrong for him. All three of these examples represent slightly different reasons for killing your henchmen but I think each one is poor form. In the case of the Ninja Turtles villain actions like that engender dissent and create a culture of fear and paranoia among your henchmen. I mean those guys just had to hold down their coworker and watch him die how do they know its not going to be them next time? If anything would inspire me to quit or revolt that would definitely be up there.In the case of Darth Vader he kills Imperial officers for failing him which stifles creativity and likely costs him a lot of high quality officers. The Empire is fighting an insurgency and as recent events in Afghanistan showed mistakes are going to be made and its difficult work. I suspect that the reason Vader is constantly saddled with incompetent officers is that he killed all the competent ones long ago and now no one wants to work with him. Also the Empire clearly doesnt promote based on merit because Vader immediately promotes a guy after the first time we see him kill someone and that guy sucked just as much.In the case of the Joker his plan almost backfires as its happening. You think when the Joker gets back to his JokerCave none of his countless other henchmen are going to be like Hey wheres Vinny and Don and Jake? Didnt they go to rob that bank with you? The Joker treats all of his henchmen as completely disposable and useless which is likely how he sees them but thats bad for morale. Its not like theres a shortage of villains hiring random thugs for stuff in Gotham. Go seek a job where your employer isnt a constant source of danger.Machiavelli said that if you cant be loved and feared its better to be feared but he touted Cesare Borgia as a great leader and that guy died naked and alone of a stab wound. The only case where I think killing your henchmen makes sense is shooting deserters in the middle of a pitched battle as that encourages continued fighting in the moment over desertion in an over the top kinda situation.

I just found this subreddit tonight as I was thinking about a lot of opinion topics so I thought it would be a good time to express this opinion of mine. Disclaimer Im neither a vegan nor a vegetarian.I understand that many vegetarians abstain from meat because they feel morally guilty or they feel that it is wrong to kill animals for food. I suppose that some vegetarians may just not want to take part in eating meat themselves and dont really care about the bigger picture but that seems like a shallow and pointless reason to be a vegetarian to me. While meateaters dont actively kill the animals themselves by eating them they support the slaughterhouses and farms that do kill the animals for food production by continuing to consume meat. If meat is demanded it will be supplied and vegetarians aim to reduce the demand. This to me seems like a much more legitimate purpose and reasoning for being vegetarian. This same philosophy compels people to vote in democratic governments. Even if they are only one person it takes many individuals to come together to elect representatives. This is the most valid argument that I can think of in favor of moral vegetarianism.This philosophy is all fine and good but vegetarians alone will not and cannot fulfill this goal by virtue of not being vegans. As long as dairy products and eggs are consumed there is still a need for dairy cows and egglaying chickens. When the cows no longer produce milk and the chickens no longer lay eggs what do you think happens to them? Generally they are turned into meat for human consumption. Vegetarians drink milk and eat cheese that comes from cows that get slaughtered. The only way to lessen meat production is to reduce the number of people with any kind of need or want for animal products. Maybe Im wrong about what vegetarians aim to accomplish exactly.

For example in Dont cha by Pussycat DollsI know you want itIts easy to seeAnd in the back of your mindI know you should be on with meAnother example Last time lover by Spice GirlsDo you think Im really cool and sexy and I knowYou wanna get with me...Could it be your first time maybeAnd Skin by RihannaSo why you standing over there with ya clothes onBaby strip down for meGo on take em off...When my bodys screaming out now.I know you hearin itI have never heard anyone consider these songs sexist let alone rapey. So if female singers can sing about seduction why a male singer cant without it being considered sexist? Or is Blurred Lines somehow categorically different than the songs I quoted and others like them? Note Im talking about the song here not the videoNote Im a woman and I consider myself a feministChange My View!However I still think some people overreacted simply because a male singer was using the same phrases that female singers use all the time because some feminists no generalisation here Im one too have become over sensitive and see rape and sexism everywhere and that hurts most the victims of actual rape and sexism men and women by making the problem seem trivial.

The honest man gets peace of mind the dishonest man gets ahead. Lately terming yourself the nice guy gets you a lot of flak because some how its been attributed an extremely negative connotation. The connotation Im describing is the belief that people who are nice are only doing so because of their ultimate ulterior motive to lay with anyone they are nice to. It assumes that their actions are purely manipulative and that they expect an actionreward sort of relationship out of people. I think this is a rude oversimplification of nice guys.In actuality these people just have a faith in peoples integrity. They are the ones that are sure to be quick and helpful about repaying a favor when someone does them a kindness. These people arent morons thoughthey dont assume sexual attraction to be a favor as popculture would tell you. The issue at play is that they are not exactly socially wellrounded so when they become involved with a girl in a platonic manner emotional attachment comes easily and quickly. This attachment only grows as the girl sees them as a closer friend because of how much time they spend together and how many favors the guy is willing to perform for them the notorious such a great friend line. Meanwhile because of the nature of attraction the mans constant desire to please is sure to seat him in the also highly stigmatized friendzone.So the situation that arises is the man unawares finds himself with a woman whom he thought a strong bond of companionship and mutual feelings was blossoming when in fact she has not the slightest romantic interest in him.The man isnt expecting to hit a favor quota and receive the adoration of his adoredhe is simply deluded into the idea that the more time he spends with her the more she will realize or have the chance to realize that he is the one she has truly loved all along. Generalizing him as an asshole who is only interested in women for sex wont help him shake his fairy tale mindset. People assume he only had sexual interests from the start which I dont believe is true. They then instantly shame him for even having those interests which only furthers the problem.

I also understand that doing YouTube is still entertainment and is no different than going to the movies or watching a comedian and I feel that many should get compensated for their work. But I dont think people should make enough to live off of YouTube the reason being is because money corrupts.I recently discovered an interesting Youtuber who I wont name. His content is somewhat interesting and he seems like a genuinely nice and downtoearth person. He only has about subs the last time I checked but hes already opened up a merch store and has a nickname for his fanbase. A while back his recording equipment broke so he opened up a paypal donation thing and made a video to try to get people to donate. Not to mention the kickstarter he launched earlier and the many times hes mentioned wanting to make a living off of YouTube. Its apparent that this person is very focused on making profits off his videos.This person is just one example of what I assume are countless others who are like this though I am also aware there exists YouTubers that dont put much thought into money.I truly believe that you need a degree of knowledge charm and responsibility to succeed in YouTube and as such requires effort and talent to do unlike what many say. But it is undeniable that a large portion of YouTubers dont put the same amount of effort in their videos than what theyre worth. This encourages people to start YouTube because they think they can make easy money off of it not because they truly enjoy it. This just spells disaster since if youre reason for doing something is for money and not for enjoyment it will eventually get boring.

However looking at birth rates demographics education levels income levels and so on... its becoming more amp more clear that the majority will soon become uneducated people. Let me be clear here by uneducated I mean people who cannot understand what is actually best for them and the country. If democracy continues to exist there is no defense against dumb people electing leadership that will ruin the country. These dumb people will have a greater say then the smart people and as a result will eventually cause the demise of democracy. Take Gaza for example. Hamas was democratically elected. Now to a levelheaded person they probably wouldnt want to elect a political party that is willing to sacrifice its own people to fulfill a political agenda. However in Gaza the majority of the people voted for Hamas and as a result they were elected. To me this is an example of democracy failing. When leadership that destroys its country is elected by a majority of people who believe said leadership is best for them simply because they are not educated or wise enough to understand the consequences of the leadership that they elected. This is just one example. I believe that in order for society to evolveexist we cannot put our faith in the people. I believe that we must be ruled by the elites of our societies.

Life might be harder with minimum wage but people can certainly survive especially if they make good financial decisions like youre supposed to.Serving food to customers is part of the servers job description and Im not required to tip other minimum wage workers following their job descriptions for providing their time and service. An example would be noncommissioned sales associates in stores. I used to work at Best Buy for hour not exactly minimum wage but pretty close to it and I personally know how much time we can spend per customer. Most interactions usually last about min or less but its not that uncommon to be with a customer for up to a hour or more in rare cases. Even then sales arent guaranteed unlike a restaurant server. Over time price of meals might go up but I why should I care about that? Ultimately theres not a significant difference if a meal is cheap and I tip vs a more expensive meal but I dont tip? You might also argue that employers might fire servers who dont get enough tips as a sign of bad service but I dont think that should be the case. If a server is providing excellent service Im more likely to spend more like with dessert or drinks. If Im getting bad service I just want to leave as soon as possible resulting in less sale.

In college it was practically currency. In my mid s I began to appreciate different kinds of flour the many methods of cooking it. I love me some pizza. When I hear somebody willing to forego the few seconds it would take to even just microwave it slightly or few minutes in a toaster oven I actually wonder why this person is putting such terribly unhealthy food into their body while getting such little enjoyment from it.Here is my logic for arriving at my contention The temperature of any food or beverage has significant impact on its flavor texture aroma and overall quality. There is a reason why fine wines and champagne have ideal serving temperatures. Pizza contains many oils mostly from cheese that are more present and aromatic when warm. The texture is significantly better when warm the crust is flakier but still soft the cheese is melted and more flavorful. It was cooked and meant to be consumed hot immediately. I dont know of any chef or restaurant that takes it from the oven to the cooler for it to reach its optimal quality before serving. Therefore warmhot pizza will always be better than cold pizza and spending even seconds in a microwave will make the enjoyment increase several orders in magnitude.

Spoilers',\n  'argument': 'I am a huge fan of Skyrims civil war storyline because both sides are somewhat morally ambiguous leaving it to each player to determine which side is worth joining. I wish to argue that when one looks at the situation as a whole the Imperial Legion is objectively the lighter shade of grey.Admittedly I have had a proImperial bias since before I first started playing Skyrim. Based on my experiences in both Morrowind especially so and Oblivion the Cyrodiilic Empire has always seemed like a very nice place to be and so Ive always been an Imperial loyalist. I was surprised that joining the rebels was even an option.But now after having analyzed the backgrounds and motivations of both sides Im even more of an Imperial loyalist than ever. This is because of the following reasons.. A united Empire would be a stronger bulwark against Dominion aggression. Also the Empire is generally good for Skyrim.This should be fairly obvious. If Skyrim was to secede from the Empire then High Rock would be cut off from Cyrodiil and could very well secede in turn. Hammerfell was already kicked out of the Empire and whatever is left of Morrowind that has not been destroyed by the eruption of Mt. Vvardenfell lies under the de facto control of the Kingdom of Argonia. EDIT Argonia was actually kicked out of Morrowind due to the efforts of House Redoran. In the event of a successful Stormcloak rebellion the Dominion would be able to destroy the nations of men piecemeal.Of course a quick and decisive victory for the rebels is not quite optimal for the Thalmor they would prefer that both sides bleed one another out and dont forget that Ulfric is a Thalmor asset of a sort. But if they cannot have that Im sure that they would prefer to take on a bunch of smaller human kingdoms than one larger human Empire. Of course for any of those who actually like the Dominion this is a wonderful reason to join the Stormcloaks.There is also the matter of trade and mutual benefit. Jarl Balgruuf says as much. Skyrim gets to benefit from the rich lands to the south and in exchange Cyrodiil gets the protection of some of the best warriors on Tamriel.. Ulfrics killing of King Toryyg sets a dangerous precedent.As Uncle Alvor put itUlfrics claim on rulership of Skyrim boils down to might begets right. Well no kidding thats how rebellions work some of you might be saying. But Ulfrics point in killing the king was that leadership comes from individual martial prowess. No king who cannot beat challengers in single combat is fit to rule. Such an attitude does not belong in any civilized society because it is hazardous to stability. Whats to stop Skyrim from falling into civil war again in a generation if someone decides that he doesnt like Ulfrics successor?It would have been different if Ulfric had asked Toryyg to declare independence from the Empire. Toryyg would have seriously considered it and if he had agreed then this point would be moot. As events turned out the way that they did Im convinced that Ulfrics rebellion is at least partially motivated by his own personal ambition he still would not have wanted to be a vassal to Toryyg.There are other points to be made about the Great War the WhiteGold Concordat the release of Hammerfell and the Markarth Incident but Ill address those if they come up.

Well maybe just on reddit. But often I feel it would be helpful to have a clear and reliable definition of what counts as art so the discussion could move forward. This also addresses a common opinion that boils down to I dont like it therefore it is not art. Anyway heres my definition of art Any form of communication with at least one layer of abstraction. edit removed word attemptedHere is why I think this works. Its mediumagnostic so it can apply equally well to any type of art including spoken word performance sculpture whatever. Its nonnormative meaning we dont have to consider whether the artist did a good job or had any particular purpose. It boils down to Was there communication? even unintentional? And Was the communication abstracted in some way? By this I mean the full content isnt just explicitly stated. Examples of what is not art A stop sign is not art. Its communication you stop here but the message is not really abstracted. A random splotch of oil on the ground that looks really awesome is not art because it wasnt produced by a person to communicate anything. Jackson Pollocks work is art because there is communication about his thoughts feelings and art itself in there although it is heavily abstracted. Difficultiesobjections Indeed for example stylization of text could be considered abstracted communication. I think this is OK. Design can be considered a type of art. Yes I guess it does. BONUS ROUND My definition of Good Art which I realize is too subjective to debate meaningfully but Im throwing it in here anyway Good art helps ones fellow humans understand better. Here understand means understanding themselves others the world around them life culture etc. It is orthogonal here to the idea of knowledge in the sense of information that hasnt been emotionally integrated into ones worldview or mindset. I like this definition because it encompasses just about all art thats considered great while allowing us to reject art thats superficially wellexecuted or conceptually interesting but ultimately worthless to the human experience. For example Star Wars fan art is usually not good art. Imitative contemporary abstract nonsense is often not good art. But maybe Jeff Koons can be considered good art again? In this light Duchamps Fountain and Malevichs black squares can be more important to me anyway than ... say... Monet. Interesting!Okay thats it!

If Im wrong in this please help me see that I honestly cant right now and as much as I believe everything Ive described below I cant help but feel like an awful person for writing off the value of an entire culture. Id appreciate any constructive feedback. Thank you.The Jewish history is a history of genocide... perpetrated by the Jewish people upon their smaller and weaker neighborsand occasionally by virtue of exceptional military leadership against larger and conventionally stronger neighbors. This goes back to ancient times but is clearly true in the present day Israelis are gathering in public places by the hundreds if not thousands dancing and singing things like There are no children left in Gaza Oleh!The Palestinians are the modernday descendants of the Philistines. The Israelis are simply perpetuating an agenda of ethnic cleansing that is thousands of years old. This is how the Israelis act displaying overwhelming support suggestions place public support for the ground campaign in Gaza as high as since when does of any public support anything its government does? for genocidal endeavors.This lasts until they come up against somebody too strong for them to defeat alone at which point its poor Israelis and persecuted Jews. World War II? The Holocaust was horrible. Id agree. Thank God well never forget all the Gypsies the homosexuals the mentally disabled and other groups that the Nazis persecuted. Yknow how they made the homosexuals wear pink triangles so theyd stand out from their neighbors and could be singled out for relocation and persecution?Wait you didnt know that? Well theres no surprise. God forbid that the Holocaust be about anyone else but the Jewish people. I dont know how the history books read in other countries in America nobody mentions anyone but the Jews. There are no photographs of anyone else being persecuted. Pink triangles pinned to homosexuals? Shit even a college education over here isnt guaranteed to go into that but I knew what a Star of David was when I was four years old and why it is so awful that Hitler did what he did to those poor Jewish people and it is awful beyond awful dont get me wrong. What about Jewish rituals?Kosher food is considered pure. Yknow why? Its because the animals are killed by being first immobilized then having their necks cut approximately halfway through with a slow sawing motion. The animal is left to bleed out in pain as Jewish tradition holds that the slow bleeding out and suffering of the animal renders the meat somehow pure. Literally the suffering adds flavor and probably another thing that was necessary thousands of years ago for health reasons that is no longer necessary but is one of those mindless traditions that is indulged in for the sake of being timehonored in the case of Jewish tradition however this seems to pass from quaint to sickeningly horrifying without much exception. Jewish culture is stuck in the mindset of a world that is thousands of years gone when it was literally kill or be killed for every little tribe on the planet and a few hundred people dead could mean the end of your ethnic group. The Jews lost in WWII and are currently a stronger force than they have ever before been in human history within living memory of the Holocaust... but they dont seem to have gotten that message. Small wonder perhaps given that theyre likely fairly indignant at how the lesser races of treated them.Jews all but invented the concept of the master race. They have a word for people who arent Jewishgentile. Now this isnt so distinct from other religious groups in some fashion southern Baptists routinely refer to other people as nonbelievers and Muslims have the famous infidel but terms like these tend to have something in common they denote other people as being ideologically wrong in the viewpoint of the individuals using said terminology. This is not the case with gentile the Jews dont want to convert you. You arent pure. Gentile denotes people who are in Jewish tradition physically inferioras is also evidenced by their use of Jewish to describe themselves as a religious faith as a political state and as an ethnicity. Even the most hardcore Christians dont identify themselves as being ethnically Christian in fact theyd vehemently deny it stating that a person must be individually saved to be Christian. Not so the Jews. Theyre superior everybody else is inferior and they dont even particularly like it when someone wants to convert. And if nobodys actually giving them a hard time? Theyll make it up ample evidence suggests that the Jews were never enslaved by the Egyptians its generally accepted that the Bible story of the enslavement is a complete fabrication. The Pyramids were built by Egyptian farmers and craftspeople who were paid for their labors and well taken care of and there is no sign of the economic collapse that would have occurred had a million slaves walked out of Egypt overnight.It is possible to honor your ancestors and revere those who fell in times of horrifying carnage and catastrophe without using it to justify an ongoing tradition of genocide barbarism and delusions of physiological superiority. Yet not only are the Israelis not doing this but we America are aiding and abetting them in their ongoing vileness. These people are targeting individual wheelchairbound people with helicopter rockets and beaches of small children with warships and were paying to refill their ammunition stockpiles.

Everyone uses philosophy adopts philosophies spouts philosophies.... but the average person does it quite poorly. Abstract thought being able handle big questions... these are skills we should be beginning to equip people with at an early age. Philosophy has a bad wrap because in a productionconsumption society it has no tangible value but the value of philosophy as a discipline is intrinsic and can effect everything we do. Just a few obvious applications and benefits to adopting critical thinking philosophy as a core discipline are Child Rearing You bring a person into the world and are tasked with guiding them the best you can through the infinite chaos of life. What is the best way to do this? How much should you intervene? Understanding your actions have tremendous influence on their developing minds.... how should you try to act and communicate? These questions and many more are abstract in nature and could be argued to be essential for any prospective parent but so many of us are not equipped to tackle such large issues. We commonly say things like I dont even want to go there... or thats too deep for me... when touching upon huge philosophical quandaries. A society which encourages critical thought and teaches us how to approach abstract questions from an early age will eventually birth a a generation of by average more prepared parents. The effects of this could be immense. Bullying A child is caught bullying another child.... the bully is called into the guidance counselors office and is asked Why did you make fun of Johnny? The bullying child will likely be rolling his eyes and saying whatever it takes to get out of the guidance counselors office at this point... and the bullying behavior will likely continue. In a society where critical thinking skills are taught from an early age the child will be used to answering why questions and thinking inward. In more circumstances by average than would likely happen now the bullying child may actually benefit from the counseling. Conformity Organized religion media peers etc. all have tremendous toxic weight on society. Freeing slaves allowing women to vote allowing homosexuals to marry allowing people to smoke weed..... these topics take far to long to filter through tradition. Critical thinking skills arm the populace with the notion of asking why and not accepting things at face value. Systems of control would have a much more difficult time normalizing the opinions of the masses. Of course the volume of examples could be vast but I assume if you are still with me you get the gist of what I am suggesting.

Some just refuse to tip at all in an misguided attempt to change the system without realizing that they are doing nothing but penalizing the server.Now a couple of advantages of my system the first one being tax fraud. Having all gratuities on the bill would keep servers more honest about declaring their income.Second having gratuity on a separate line rather than absorbed in the cost of the meal would allow for negotiations on the tip in the event of abhorrent service. I suggest that the customer reserves the right to dispute the gratuity in extreme instances the way it is done now with automatic gratuity for large parties etc.Third it takes care of the folks that are simply cheap and want service without paying for it.

God is supposed to be allpowerful meaning that rebellion is futile.So were left with only two possible explanations. Either heaven is not a utopia and some people find Gods unchallenged authoritarian tyranny a questionable system of governance. God is not omnipotent or at the very least Lucifer is also phenomenally powerful.We can extrapolate from the incongruities in the logic of the information weve been given that God is clearly lying to us and either inflating the desirability of heaven or the measures of his own power or both. Why would somebody do this? It sounds like an elaborate propaganda campaign to win over the souls of humans at the behest of a corrupt tyrant. Plus if we conclude that God is a liar then nothing in the Bible can be taken for granted any more.But then why worship Lucifer? Well although theres very little information to go on in the Bible bad things are constantly blamed on the devil and since weve established God is a filthy propagandist this smells like an elaborate smear campaign and frankly some of it is a little fanciful.If we approach the Bible with the conclusion that God is trying to manipulate us many items that we would ordinarily take at face value become startling condemnatory evidence of a manipulative otherworldly dictator.

There are a great many women with high sex drives of course. But in general I believe that men at large are more desiring of sex. One reason I believe this is that men patronize prostitutes in significant numbers and men are willing to trade things of real value like money in order to get sex. I cant think of any scenario in which women are willing to give up something of significant value in order to get sex. I also believe this is true because testosterone is largely responsible for the human sex drive. The more testosterone you produce the more libidinous you are. Men who have lower testosterone have less of a sex drive. These men seek out testosterone treatment and notice a dramatic increase in sex drive once the treatment becomes effective. Women produce significantly less testosterone than men consequently their sex drives are typically lower. Women are less proactive when it comes to seeking out sex partners. I dont have support for this one but in my experience men are the ones who are proactive about directly asking women out or making direct romantic gestures. Its usually incumbent upon men to do the asking to make the first move. Men are compelled to play by these rules because women are the ones who have the thing that men desire and men are the ones who are forced to act because of the desire. Also men are much more likely to say yes to a request for an immediate sexual encounter than women are. According to this study women were much much less likely to say yes to a proposal for immediate sex whereas men were much much more likely to say yes. Watch this video. Many of the men features men leap at the change to have sex with the girl despite the fact that she could be leading them into some kind of trap or that she could have an STD of some kind. There are only a few examples I know there is another video in which is about as well but the average of men that say yes it much higher than the average in the gender opposite video. The ones who dont leap to sleep with her at least seriously consider doing it this is because they want very badly to have sex with a beautiful girl. The women in this video dont react nearly as positively. None of them leap at the chance. They arent instantly aroused the way the men are by even the proposal. I think its reasonable to conclude that the desire just isnt as intense. You might argue that the desire becomes as intense when the desire is provoked and that this situation does not provoke the desire but if its so difficult to provoke the same amount of desire doesnt that mean that there is less desire in general? please!'},\n {'id': 't3_2c1mga',\n  'titles': 'I genuinely believe that the formation of an Israeli state was immoral to begin with and that peace between Israel and Palestine is not possible without the Israeli at least partially ceding its claims to Palestine.',\n  'argument': 'Now I may have my history wrong but the way I see it is that it was the Palestinians land first.

The long and short of it is that if I tried to live openly back home I would be put in prison for any period of time ranging from between and years. I realize that this law and others like it are possibly in violation of several human rights declarations which these countries have ostensibly ratified. I also want this law to be repealed and for this discrimination against sexual minorities to end.However as people who follow this issue are aware the African nations that have these laws on their books have resisted calls to repeal these laws. They view calls for repeal as the West trying to impose its moral standards on Africa which has expressed its morality through the passage of these laws. I am aware of the logical inconsistency of this position i.e. that the homophobia is a result of the adoption of religion which itself is a Western import and do not want to discuss that here. What I do wonder is that the leaders of these nations have asked that they be respected as sovereign nations and for the West to respect their laws. They say that just as they do not impose their cultural norms on the West the West should not impose their cultural norms on Africa and the most common example they cite is that of polygamy. It is very common in several African nations but I was surprised to learn is actually criminalized in the US and Canada. So if the West criminalizes the African cultural practice of polygamy and is unwilling to repeal the laws that do so then surely African nations can criminalize homosexuality and the West should leave them alone.Im not sure how to mount an argument to this. The right to marry a consenting spouse is in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights so if a womanman decides to marry another manwoman with an existing spouse it should not be criminal as long as the three of them consent to it.

We focused so much on it I thought that the Declaration of Independence was the most important document America ever had. While it definitely isnt unimportant the DoI was more a list of reasons why the King of England sucked and why they wanted independence as their own nation. The Constitution however is the backbone to how America is run far more relevant to modern American life than the Declaration.Granted st and nd graders might not fully understand what the Constitution is and its easier to teach the Declaration to them but I think that th and th graders would definitely be able to understand the basics of the Constitution Bill of Rights and amendments perhaps even rd graders.The Declaration is great for when you want to teach kids about the Revolutionary War. However theres not much of a need to spend so much time on it since in my opinion its just not as relevant to American life as the Constitution. While its important its more important to teach about history that had a bigger impact on todays world. The Constitution is a prime example for American life since its still being used and referenced all the time today! When was the last time you heard of the Declaration of Independence in the mainstream news? Okay Nicholas Cage stole it in a movie once but other than that nothing much. The Constitution is constantly in the news however and in order for any of the branches of government to do anything they have to look up the Constitution to see if its okay.I think that if we teach American kids early on what the Constitution is theyre more likely to know how the law actually works how the country is run and the actual intent the Founding Fathers had for America. They might also become more interested in politics in their adult lives since they would actually know how the American government is structured. Plus with the Constitution it would also help teach students how America changed over time and what the values and standards were for American people living a hundred or two hundred years ago. It might even get them to debate amongst themselves if they agree with parts of the Constitution or not and its important for kids to learn how to properly have a debate and not just a bunch of angry arguments.Most of the kids I know can barely name any amendments except for like freedom of speech and they seem to be under the impression that freedom of speech means that you can say whatever you want and shouldnt have to have any social repercussions for it right to guns and womens suffrage. Its almost like they only take the time to learn about the Constitution when they need to win an argument.

I was obviously upset when I experienced this and as a result I performed poorly in my th year when I went back to school. I ended up with a GPA so low that it was an embarrassment to my Asian family who are sticklers about marks. I dont even wear the Iron Ring that you get after your engineering degree because I simply didnt deserve it. One day I took some time for myself to reflect what I did wrong in my life that led me to this situation. I came to realize that I was simply an emotional person overreacting to little things trying to achieve perfection and getting things right the first time. I want to achieve the last two things but the first thing was getting in my way. From that day on I decided to basically shut off my emotion to everyone and everything which took awhile to achieve. By shutting off my emotions I was able to get past what happened and wiping the memories. I then started thinking of procedures in my head when I encounter certain situations and control which emotions to express or not at all. For example I was making breakfast this morning when I dropped an egg on the floor by accident for the first time in awhile. The normal reaction that most people would make would be anger or frustration but I instead went straight to my room to get paper towels and clean up the mess without making a fuss about it. I seem to perform better than where I was over a year ago and stopped making mistakes recursively. By acting like a robot Im able to do things better and faster than I used to without the emotional distractions. I admit there are times when I have sudden bursts of emotion when I think about something e.g. crying but I take that as a deficiency and restabilize my mind back to robot mode which is still a challenge for me. It kind of makes me wish there was a delete function to remove memories like a computer can. Explaining my life background has gotten me to the view of seeing emotion as a flaw of humanity. Humans have been fighting each other since forever and I think emotion is what sometimes leads to bad decisions rather than using logic and reasoning.

A quick search gives us thisWhile this is good enough I dont think its sufficient. This may be the definition of art but it is hardly the purpose. The purpose of art imo is to convey a complex idea. And that is really what comes into question when it comes to Video Games. Nobody could really contest that a game creator uses creative skill and imagination to make their product. The contention comes when you think about whether games convey an idea or are simply entertainment. In the rest of this post I will show firstly the difference between things in a medium that do and do not fulfill the purpose of art. I will then show how video games are a superior art form as opposed to moves painting and the like. Finally Ill show some examples of games that fit into the categories of art and nonart. I realize that Im dealing with a lot of abstracts here and its impossible to be truly objective but Ill do my best to represent what I mean.What does and does not fit the definition and purpose of artThe easiest medium for this would be photography. First ill show some pictures that fulfill neither the definition or purpose of art this is not art this is not art and this is not art The second category is a bit more difficult but here are some that fit the definition of art but not the purpose This fits the definition of art so does this and this They are all certainly a product of human creativity and fit the definition of art. But what complex idea do they convey do they meet the purpose of art?Finally pictures that meet both the definition and purpose of art This is one Another Id even say this tooI was planning to do music and movies as well but these media are much more difficult to breakdown and as a result it would make this about twice as long and three times as abstract.Why Video Games are a Superior Art FormThe main idea here is that video games are interactive. You directly experience the feeling or idea that is being represented in the work. This makes it a much more powerful and personal experience than watching a movie or listening to a song. I have never went to a friend and talked for minutes about how a song in which the artist was portraying their anger and talked about how angry I was. But I have had a bad game experience and went to talk to my friend for minutes about how I was mad. What im trying to say is best represented in this quote ...you dont have to empathize with a character on a screen the feeling happens directly to you. Its like taking the phrease show dont tell and moving it to the next level feel dont show. I find that games are the best art form because they fulfill the purpose of art in a way no other medium thus far can possibly hope to.Most of this power comes from good game design but this is also true of other forms of media. A badly made movie will fail to show the struggle of a fatherson dynamic as well as The Godfather.I realize that this is going to be the most controversial pert of my post so fell free to reply even if you think that video games are an art form but not the best as I claim here.What games do and do not fit the definition and purpose of artNote I am not saying that the games listed here are good or bad simple whether or not the fit the definition and purpose of art. Ill be using commonplace titles so that even people who dont play very many games will have a general idea about what game Im talking about.Games that do not fit the definition of art FIFA Farmville and Solitaire . You can see that most of these are simulations of things in real life and are not very creative mostly they fill the purpose of simple entertainment or time filling. This is not to say that simulations cannot be artful as rd World Farmer is a simulation game that fulfills the purpose of art very well.Games that fit the definition of art but not the purpose. Super Mario Bros. Its hard to think of specific examples of this but I think the one is sufficient. Its a very creative and well designed game.Nest are games that fulfill both the definition and purpose of art. In this section Ill talk for a short biit about what parts of these games make it artful. Amnesia The Dark Descent this game is fear and panic incarnate. Mark of the Ninja ever wonder what its like to be a ninja? Papers Please this game is really difficult to describe pretty much you are a worker at the boarder of an oppressive dictatorship its definitely worth a play if you are looking got something truly unique. Lastly Antichamber for if you ever want to break your brain.With games I have added a th category that comes directly due to interactivity. These ae games that can be art. I think what I mean by that will become more clear as I show some examples. Call of Duty of course you have the well known year old who slept with everyone mother but many parts of this game are powerful message about what war is like there are better representations of this but this game fits this category very well. League of Legends this game can be anything from a mindless time sink to an immersive experience where you directly experience victory defeat panic triumph fear and even the occasional sportsmanship. The Elder Scrolls V Skyrim this is truly the best representation of this category anybody who has played can tell you about the amazing landscapes I just gotta freak out for a second when I first saw the Soul Cairn my brain exploded. And the last area of the main quest just makes you feel like a badass who has crossed worlds to beat this evil its just awesome. The potential art in this game is immense from the world design even to how the character interacts allows the player to fell and be something the never could. This is what I mean by the category can be art. These games fulfill the purpose of art if the player makes it so.TLDRGames are a superior art form because they have interactivity and allow the player to directly feel the idea that is being conveyed by the creators. This at its core fulfills the purpose of art better than any other medium can. All media have things that are art and that are not art. Just because you can point to some games that are not artistic does not mean the medium is invalid as a form of art.'},\n {'id': 't3_2bkc6k',\n  'titles': 'Sex should be in no regards considered a basic human right when discussing birth control',\n  'argument': 'So Lena Dunham has once again caused another stir in the social justice world by asking twitter why they need birth control. First of all even as a woman I find that an extremely childish point of view. To need birth control. I would like to preface this by saying that yes I am aware of the various conditions that birth control aides and for the sake of this those are not what Im talking about here. For all nonmedical reasons no one needs birth control.I am a huge advocate for safe sex and the prevention of pregnancy and the spread of STDs through birth control and condoms. That being said I dont think sex is a basic human right. No one needs to have sex every three days or theyll face death maiming etc. Sex is pleasurable and sex is fun and sex can create life. But by no means is it a necessity in the way that many claim it is. Furthermore claiming that your healthcare should be required to cover birth control outside of health concerns because its a basic right is absolutely ridiculous.If you are not prepared to make birth control a priority by budgeting for it then you need to make the decision to either practice unprotected sex and face the consequences or abstain until you can afford to make birth control a priority. Here are some of the main reasons why I think so Birth Control doesnt have to be super expensive as low as a month. If you cant afford a month for birth control you definitely cant afford a kid and should be able to abstain until you are more financially stable. There are other nonpenetrative methods for sexual release If you cant make birth control a priority for your own personal budget then why should you expect your health care to. I know this treads very closely with past s on birth control being included in health care but in this case I think its hard to talk about one without the other. I personally think persecuting companys for refusing to provide birth control in their health care package not that the woman couldnt just buy it without insurance! is as assine as getting upset if an orthodox jewish meat company refused to purchase pork for their work cafeteria. I feel like Im one of the few feminists and I use that term very loosely who doesnt believe that sex is a basic human right. ?'},\n {'id': 't3_2bk0qs',\n  'titles': 'I believe that in certain cases capital punishment shouldnt have to be humane.',\n  'argument': 'It probably goes without saying that I support capital punishment if not in practice then at least in principle.More than that I find the outcry sparked from the botched executions of rapists and murderers to be somewhat ridiculous.

If someone has killed another person by say raping and then burying their victim alive what makes an hour or two of suffering on their way out so unacceptable?Since Reddit is largely liberal Id expect a healthy response but let me clarify my position before rebuttals are made. My issue is with the ethics of inflicting pain before execution. Im perfectly aware and agree that according to law anything more than a swift and painless death would be inhumane and therefore illegal.. Im also assuming that such additional suffering would be administered to admitted and unapologetic killers whose crimes were heinous enough to warrant such action. The uncertainty surrounding most court trials would be enough to keep me from supporting any actual policy for this.

I have never been a sports fan and I find obsessing over sports ridiculous. Not mearly watching a game but the obsession of them. But that is not what this is about I just think its important and fair to be clear where Im coming from. What this is stemming from is that I watched a documentary last night Schooled the Price of College Sports. If you want a more in depth understanding you can watch it or Ill just give the very brief summary as I understood it. One side says players should be compensated for the work they do. The other side says it is essentially extracurricular activities and they are students merely taking part in activities while at college and that paying them would ruin college sports. Now this was a pretty slanted documentary but I was still able to appreciate the perspective from both sides. On one hand the reality is that college sports players are part of a big business that makes lots of money. On the other hand school should exist for learning not creating a big profit making businesses centered around sports. My view is this The problem is not the coaches or the schools making money and not paying the students afterall they all just have a job and are trying to be paid as best that they can. Fine I have no issues with that. On the other hand those students are making a LOT of money for other people and not seeing a dime for it. What the problem really is to me is that people should stop supporting the entire system altogether. Paying or more... If you want sports entertainment you should go pay professional sports entertainment. The only reason those sports should exist within a college setting is for the players themselves something to do on the side while theyre attending school. The moment the populace starts being willing to pay them vast sums of money and pay such a mind to star college athletes they have become the problem. Leave the students alone to learn and do what they want to do on the side while theyre there. I say the fans are the only solution to the problem because both the NCAA and the Studentathletes are right in what they say. The fact is there just shouldnt be that much money being generated for college sports and the only reason there is is because fans are obsessive and willing to pay ridiculous amounts of money to them. I believe fans are wrong to do this and should stop and that if youre a fan of college sports a paying fan of college sports that you should stop contributing to a problem that can only be solved by you ceasing to provide them so much ridiculous money.'},\n {'id': 't3_2bh5ak',\n  'titles': 'In general I dont think Italians Jews or Arabs should be considered white.',\n  'argument': 'Hey .

Id like somebody to talk me through the economic reasoning for having interest before discussing the pros and cons and moral implications.The reason I believe it should be banned at the moment is because it allows money to be made simply from having wealth. It is a vehicle for the wealthy to accumulate wealth from the poor. Also there is no choice. If you want a loan or have a bank account you MUST payreceive interest. There is no way you can withdraw your consent on ideological grounds therefore we are trapped by interest. What are the results of this? It means payday loan companies like wonga can carry out statesanctioned theft of your possessions and home to cover your debts. It means that you are penalised for not being rich. To say this is allowed when really there is no way you can disagree with the system seems wrong to me.But why ban it? I admit I have only been clued into this view because usury is something that is criticised in Abrahamic religions. My view is not well informed and so I would like some people to convince me of the opposite view.. So the main benefits of interest seem to be compensating financiers for lending money allowing small businesses to have access to capital and allowing people to own items they otherwise wouldnt be able to. I am realising that economies will grind to halt if financiers cannot make money out of lending money without a viable alternative.. There does seem to be an alternative to interest in the form of Islamic Banking whereby interest is not charged. Another system has been illustrated by uProjectShamrock here Whether these are good or bad systems is still unclear to me but it illustrates alternatives are possible.. The way we charge interest in western societies directly empowers financiers.

The majority of my knowledge comes from a few Super Meat Boy speed runners and Dark Souls speed running. It seems a common tactic in the speed running community to use tricks in the game to quickly get ahead. This is exactly what you would expect from someone trying to finish the game as fast as possible however often times these tricks can cause the player to completely skip a large portion of the game. My main example would be whats referred to as the Brownie Skip in Super Meat Boy. Brownie is a boss in super meat boy on the world called the Salt Factory. In order to beat him you have to outrun him through a maze like structure and get to the top of the structure. Doing this normally could take a little longer than a minute. Perhaps less I dont know the exact amount of time but definitely significantly more than when using the exploit. Performing the Brownie Skip the player is placed into the race runs immediately to the right outside of few and pauses the game and then ends up being able to land on top of the platform that was initially impeding their progress. If you dont know or that explanation didnt make sense here is what it looks like. In my opinion this and tactics like it dont belong in speed running. While it does make you beat the game faster youre not actually playing the game. Youre playing who knows how and when to pause the game and how to wiggle the stick the best. The idea of speed running is about being able to beat the game the fastest and bosses are an important part of the game. Actually beating the boss shows off more skill by far. !'},\n {'id': 't3_2bclgt',\n  'titles': 'I dont believe someone should be disallowed to own a gun due to a mental illness.',\n  'argument': 'I often hear people discussing gun control legislation as common sense seemingly as a way of getting out of having to actually explain the logic behind them. To me the most significant manifestation of this issue is the tremendous amount of support for legislation that would disallow anyone diagnosed with a mental illness to own a firearm. At first thought such a measure seems to make sense. Surely this legislation would make it such that dangerous mentally ill people cannot obtain firearms making the world a safer place.But consider this. A man returns from active duty and decides that he wants to purchase a pistol to protect himself. The man is experiencing PTSD symptoms but knows that if he seeks help he will be barred from purchasing a gun so what does he do? He hides the symptoms hes experiencing and he buys a gun. So then instead of having an armed mentally ill man who is seeking treatment and whose symptoms are being controlled you have an armed man who needs medication or at the very least professional help. Legislation like this deters people from seeking help for their mental illnesses and puts guns in the hands of more unstable people. To me thats why this type of legislation makes no sense.

Can an year old give consent? that is almost a definite no. But past that if a kid can give consent to be picked up to be punched by his friends to ride a bike to ride a car why can heshe not give consent to sex? Of course this view must hold that those even those younger than those that can speak can give consent but I wont go there in this as I will get a bunch of hate mail and witchhunts as is common in western societys irrational hatred of anyone defending the pedos. So what makes sex so taboo for children? I argue that it is subjective. You grew up seeing it as dirty so you dont want your or others children engaging in it because you see it as dirty and want to keep their innocence for as long as possible. Other crimes such as murder assault and robbery are much more objective they do clear harm and clearly violate anothers right to life their body and their property. So to expand on this. If a year old can give consent to a or something of that sort why then can they not give consent to someone much older? It is because you view it as icky. I will admit in the majority of cases the child is a victim of rape. So clearly if the victim speaks out soon or later the case should be looked into and prosecuted with the right evidence. But it is clear to me that if a yo can give consent to a yo then he can give consent to anyone.On to the next part sex offenders registry is complete bullshit. First of all I fucking hate background checks. They perpetuate poverty and only cause more crime. It makes it hard for criminals to get jobs and they resort back to crimes. On top of that sex offenders are treated so much worse. Why does raping someone adult or child make you so much worse than someone who murdered and didnt get life? It is bullshit. There is the argument but then how would we know if theres a sex offender living next door to my children! Well thats incredibly unfortunate that you dont get to know everyones backgrounds so you can keep your precious little critters safe but that should be your responsibility. People make mistakes but should be able to return to being normal human beings citizens when they do their time. Not to mention that the prison system does not help pedophiles change their ways at all. That needs to change as well.Furthermore the most egregious of these I find is the acceptance on reddit though suprisingly the internet is far better at condemning this than the regular population to pedophiles being beat stabbed and raped in jail. Reddit and chan are actually decent compared to regular society in recognizing that this is fucking insane! It happens way to often. And there is little activism against the abuse sex offenders get in prison or even abuse in general in prison.So I clearly feel very strongly about this youll get bonus points from me if you change my opinion about that last one.

I have attended competitions and known several friends who cheerlead and though I am a very active physically fit person I would still find it challenging to learn and execute many moves in cheerleading and find it impressive and enjoyable to watch.However I dont consider it a sport. This is not a pejorative assertion but even so I have experienced pushback for it in the past. I also dont subscribe to the Olympic definition of sport. In my view a sport needs to be able to be won by objective means. That is to say you need to have a goal that can be reached make it to a certain point first score more points lift the most weight etc. Obviously officials make wrong calls and goals in hockeysoccer for instance are wrongly disallowedwrongly given occasionally but at the end of the day there is still an objective resultoutcome but for the number of games they decide on the merit of the mistake alone Im willing to consider them a reasonable minority. Team A Team B Usain Bolt wins race with time of . seconds etc. I believe events decided solely by judges cannot be sports and will always be subjective in nature. Sports like boxing with judging elements are still sports in my view because there is an objective way to win knocking the opponent out so they cannot respond to a count for instance. The judging is a tiebreaker and I am fine with that. But in judgeonly events an identical routine could win one contest and lose another simply by virtue of human subjectivity alone.

Generosity is defined as showing a readiness to give more of something as money or time than is strictly necessary or expected. From what I know Id say that in richer circles donating to something andor someone is in fact expected and that you may be perceived badly if you dont donate. Giving above a certain amount can serve as cheap advertising for those donating and serves to increase their reputation with the public. The tax benefits available for those who donate at large amounts can offset the cost of donating and I believe even provide an incentive to give in the first place. There is a line for each person that differs Im sure that below which they are scraping by and above which they do not need to worry about making ends meat or having small luxuries. Someone making in excess of figures certainly lives a very comfortable life even if they cant afford that nd private jet they were drooling over.Lastly Ill put forth what I think is a better way of deciding whom to call generous and whom to not. Make it a rule that unless sacrifice of some sort factors into your gift you are not being generous. Therefore if I donate money to an AIDS research foundation and as a direct result cannot buy the new fancier computer I wanted then I am generous. If a millionaire donates proportionately the same amount but it forces them to change nothing then they are not. The bigger the sacrifice the more generous the person. And yes if a millionaire decides to donate the money they intended to spend on a yacht meaning they dont get a boat or even get a smaller one than what they wanted Id consider that a sacrifice and therefore that they were being generous.I also add that I personally value the gift of time and effort above most monetary gifts because thats something that everyone values about the same. I realize I can be tone deaf when communicating sometimes but I did not mean to imply that not being called generous specifically means you are not doing something good. You absolutely are and clearly those who have more and give very little of it help finance things more than a collective of persons with meager wealth. The point I was initially making was that generous is a very high praise to offer someone and I feel that it can at least sometimes be perceived as a cheap way earning praise for very little. Im reminded of the Biblical story of the woman who gave her last cents in offering and was praised by Jesus as giving more than anyone else. Thats basically the comparison Im making. This view was not in any way meant to comment on how people should receive donationsgifts. Any gift given freely is worth thanking and worthy of praise from the recipient.

Getting an unreasonable buyer is random and accordingly there will be sellers who get pushed out due to nothing more than the bad luck of getting several unreasonable buyers in a row. No matter how good you are your eBay account now has a halflife.This is a consequence of an American cultural malaise fivestarism the drive towards unreasonable standards of perfection and the perfect is the enemy of the good. A pass is a good mark. Three star service is actually good service. Three stars means that it wasnt noticably great or noticably terrible you just got exactly what you wanted. Every transaction that you did today that you didnt even notice what you got there was three star service. You deserve three star service. What makes better service better is that you didnt actually deserve it.In a sane world if you get better than acceptable service thats four stars. If you get the best service youve ever seen thats five. If you were disappointed in some way which is clearly attributable to the service provider but you still got moreorless what you wanted thats two stars. If they were completely incompetent and absolutely failed you thats one star. Or zero if they intentionally angered you.However those who decide these things in eBay Uber Walmart Blizzard various American call centres etc etc have all somehow come to the bizarre decision that acceptable should mean five stars and anything less than five stars is unacceptable.

Advocates of the plan to split off said it meant better schools and a better life in general for the new citys citizens. I was rooting for those who wanted the new city instead of being horrified. I like gentrification it means Starbucks and decent shopping malls. It means less ghettos and thugs and crime. Those who opposed it talked about the fact that poor people would be left behind in the old city. Cant the old city just have construction projects to make things nice and shiny and new? Apartment complexes can start refurbishing projects and suburbs can have contests for who can DIY their house to look the nicest.

I know this is considered tabboo to many people but here are my views Why I prefer welldone steak First of all by well done I mean brown all the way through which is not the same as completely burned so that the steak resembles a hockey puck in appearance and flavor. I have had some phenomenal steaks cooked well done at moderatetoupscale steakhouses and the outside was barely charred at all. After trying steaks cooked to a variety of temperatures I feel that well done is the best according to my tastes. I dont feel that the flavor is substantially lost by cooking the steak for longer. Of course each temperature has its own distinct flavor but I do not feel that a properly prepared welldone steak sacrifices much if any flavor. The same goes for texture if prepared properly. That said in general I prefer my food cooked all the way through. When I cut into a rare steak and am greeted with a brightred gush of raw beef and bloodlike juice I completely lose my appetite. Presentation is important when eating such an expensive meal. Finally a fully cooked steak reduces the probability of picking up a foodborne illness. So its a win anyway you cut it pardon the pun. Why there shouldnt be a stigma around ordering welldone steak First of all Im the customer and its my money. I have heard that some restaurants not all obviously might give you a worse cut of meat if you ask for it cooked welldone. This is unreasonable and contrary to the spirit of a clientfocused food service industry where the customer orders and pays for a meal and the restaurant delivers. If restaurants or chefs are unwilling to start with the same quality ingredients for all orders regardless of specific customer requests then they should expressly forbid such orders on the menu so that customers with particular preferences can choose to dine elsewhere.

Instead of privatizing education we should be focusing on how to reform the public system.I went to private schools all my life. I still go to one. The endless tales of bad teachers that we hear about in public schools can be accompanied by an equally long list of bad private school teachers.Let add to the pot of bad teacher storiesIn th grade I had trouble writing. The private school my parents paid well over year in tuition couldnt even tell me what was wrong. When we changed schools we found out what the issue was.When I was in th grade my math teacher moved to fast for me. I had to take an extra class from the learning support specialist which was effectively my math class. I also had to take a Christian studies course. When I asked the teacher questions such as If God is omnipresent why is he spaceless and timeless? I was given a vague answer. Any student who asked a hard question was given an unhelpful answer though that might be a problem with religion rather than with private schools. It wasnt an honest and objective analysis of Christianity rather it was a circlejerk of God is Great! Or Praise Jesus! I couldve used that time more effectively with the learning support specialist.In th grade my math teacher was incompetent beyond words. Literally all the parents and students hated her. The only reason that amalgamation of cells was ever hired was because school policy required that both the husband and wife be employees at the school. She started off each morning with a prayer which she couldve used as time to help struggling students. Instead of helping struggling students she would talk about her kids proselytize during class or make us ask our peers. She also made me take a test when I was jetlagged. Again the learning support specialist had to pick up the slack. Then theres my personal favorite of these stories from her she made the Asian kids teach for her. Funny thing is we couldve been spared from her. There was an applicant whose qualifications went beyond an accounting degree and having an SO who got a job at the same establishment. The reason he wasnt hired? He was agnostic. Instead of caring about the students the school cared about an agenda.I had to take that Christian studies course again in th grade and we were shown a video from Ben Steins Expelled and they contested evolution in that class. Im okay with the Bible being taught as mythology but to challenge scientific fact is utter bullshit. In my th grade year there a someone in my grade whose parents were getting a divorce. He became depressed. The school which practically made us memorize the sermon on the mount decided that the most Christlike action possible was to suspend him. What good what that have done? He wouldve been brought closer to the divorce. The divorce is what made him depressed in the first place. Thats what Jesus would do? I think what Jesus would do is get the hell away from the school campus.In my th grade year there was a band teacher who had an ego bigger than Mount Everest. He made all the band students play in his goodbye concert. There was one kid who had to attend a funeral which happened to be on the same day as the ego concert. This guys Christlike action? He threatened to FAIL the kid if he didnt go to the concert. Through all these examples Ive shown that teachers can be just as incompetent and egotistical as public school teachers. Whatever bureaucracy plagues public schools can be replaced by even worse teaching standards.'},\n {'id': 't3_2aymhj',\n  'titles': 'Dysgenics is real and the only way to avoid collapse is government control of reproduction.',\n  'argument': 'It is natural for people to be averse to the idea of eugenics. The belief that some people constitute better biological stock than others is hard to swallow we do not choose our genes and none of us like the idea of choices being made by others for our own supposed benefit. We believe that we have a right to reproduce a right to bodily autonomy that precludes government control of reproduction. Our individualist society places ultimate worth in the individual no matter how beneficial something may be for the collective it is wrong if it infringes on the rights of the individual. This is faulty reasoning and an indication that we are out of touch with reality. The individual does not exist we are continuously and overwhelmingly shaped by external forces outside of our control our genetic code our upbringing in childhood the societies in which we live. In turn our actions shape the genetic makeup of the future shape the future families and societies. This being realized it is clear that to place the individual above all else is to suppose that each individuals selfinterested actions will eventually benefit the collective as a whole. Adam Smith called this the invisible hand Of course Smith was referring solely to economic growth patterns which are not necessarily good indicators of true progress. One need only comprehend the devastation wrought upon the Earth as a consequences of the Industrial Revolution to see that economic growth may not be a good thing after all.Throughout history we have been shown that in a competitive individualized society that to which we are all entitled quickly becomes degraded Which brings me to my point something to which every individual feels entitled is the production of children. We shudder at the thought of someone other than ourselves controlling our prospective children. We can see no reason for another entity to restrict our ability to reproduce. However such reasons do exist and they are quite powerful. Among these are. The introduction of a child into the world is a fundamentally violent action. Parents do not ask for consent when they have children they are forcing the world to accommodate the presence of their child. All parents hope that their children will become self sufficient and ultimately benefit the world around them but clearly this is not the case.. It has long been known that less intelligent people have more children This inverse relationship between IQ and fertility has worried scientists since industrialization in the th century. It has been shown that IQ is largely heritable gt with the conclusion being that the Flynn Effect is a phenotypic consequence of better nutrition that masks our steady downward spiral of genotypic intelligence. Not only are less intelligent people predisposed towards having more children but our society encourages diversion from intellectual pursuits. The explosion of mass media and popular culture is very troubling the average American spends hours a day watching television We have entered an age where selection for beneficial traits has reached an all time low and so has selection against deleterious traits. Plastic surgery infertility treatment deodorant simple and repetitive jobs the welfare state makeup and fashion lack of disease and natural predators the list goes on. Now more than ever there exist a multitude of forces that accommodate genetic weakness and allow these individuals to reproduce with the same vigor as those who are more genetically fit.. The world is experiencing a real crisis of of overpopulation and consequential deterioration of the natural and built environment. It is said that education will lead to lower fertility of course I agree with this! And that is precisely the problem the educated and intelligent people decide to have fewer children. Those who are unintelligent either through lack of education or lack of aptitude will always have more children if it is in their self interest to do so. The potential economic worth of a child is hard to overstate when one is living in poverty.To summarize my points I believe that when an individual makes their contribution to the gene pool of the future by reproducing they are perpetuating their own genetic deficiencies to the detriment of not only their descendants but those who will live with their descendants. Note that I would never suggest that genetically weak people be killed. They deserve all the compassion that we should grant to any individual. It is this compassion that I feel towards future unborn individuals that leads me to believe that eugenics is necessary. Human civilization has reached a point where natural selection no longer favors intelligent cooperative sociable and moral individuals. It is a world where anonymity and division of labor have enabled the potential for everyone to survive and have children. But such survival is not thriving! The value of a population is measured in its quality not its quantity. With dysgenic freereproduction there is very little that encourages high quality low quantity births and very little that discourages low quality high quantity births.As to how such eugenic goals may be realized I point to China for inspiration Incentives for individuals to have few children is the first step. Once the total birthrate has become low enough to maintain a stable population measures can be taken to improve genetic structure of future born children. These might involve extensive sperm amp eggs banks where individuals identified as genetically fit i.e. high IQ noncriminal genuinely altruistic physically wellformedhealthy could supply the majority of new children. People on the lower end of the genetic spectrum could still raise children provided they pass certain testsbackground checks ensuring that they will not be abusive and corrupting. I propose all people pass these tests to qualify as adoptive parents even genetically fit individualsI foresee that responses will suggest that I am placing too much concern on heredity that is I am giving undue weight to nature over nurture. To this I contend that we often underestimate the power of heredity. Of course all humans share common ancestors if you go back far enough. It is generally accepted that we all came from the same initial genetic stock But the reality is that our physical manifestation is determined mostly by the genetic structures of our parents and our environment in the womb infancy and early childhood. Our brains are physical organs whose physical form is determined almost entirely by genes. People have long recognized the importance of the brain and many attempted to physically deform the brain for mystical or social reasons. Heredity is recognized as the major determining component in intelligence among other behavioral aspects If you wish to change my view you will have to convince me that. Dysgenic collapse is not only not imminent but impossible. I see no difference between it happening years from now or a thousand or even a million. The threat of its occurrence must be dealt with at some point. . Individualist and free society where no government oversight over reproduction exists can counter dysgenic trends of its own accord. Show me that people are willing to embrace technology that will rewrite the genetic codes of fetuses rendering concerted naturalreproduction eugenicist efforts unnecessary. . That a future with dysgenic collapse a la Idiocracy is not necessarily a bad thing so long as an elite exists that will take care of the unwittingly enslaved humans.I look forward to seeing some responses soon.'},\n {'id': 't3_2ayhxt',\n  'titles': 'I think basic income is wrong because nobody is entitled to money just because they exist.',\n  'argument': 'This question has been asked before but I havent found someone asking the question with the same view that I have.I feel like people dont deserve to have money in our society if they dont put forth anything that makes our society prosper.

Under this proposal the northern and southern portions of New York would be separated. Long Island New York City the boroughs Queens Brooklyn the Bronx Manhattan and Staten Island and Westchester County would belong to one state whereas all NY counties north of Westchester would be considered another. Albany would remain the capital of the northern region and Manhattan would become the capital of the southern state.The state of New York is considered to be a blue state. However one may find that the geographic majority of New York is actually conservative. While New York being considered a blue state accounts for the majority of the people living in it it excludes the vast geographic majority. This is due to the fact that southern New York is very population dense. There are . million people living in the state of New York. . million people live in New York City . million people on Long Island and a little over people living in Westchester County. This means that out of the . million people in the state . million people make up a region of square miles NY as a whole minus the regions I described above. The liberal south of the state is deciding how the many conservative areas are run. A resident of Long Island or NYC may find it dangerous and unnecessary to own a gun. However youre likely to find signs that blatantly oppose the New York S.A.F.E Act The political atmosphere of the geographic majority of New York is very different from that of the populous majority. Dividing the state in two would allow for the two regions to make political decisions that respect their populations. Currently the rich liberals in New York City and its surrounding areas neglect the rest of the state. This would not be an issue if decisions made in Albany the state capital affected the nearby counties and not those hours away with a different atmosphere and different views. The different areas have different needs lets serve them better.Taxes are also high in New York as is the cost of living. This once again is likely due to the fact that the standard of living in most of New York City Long Island and Westchester is ridiculously high. In Westchester and Long Island you have your stereotypical white uppermiddle class picketfence families. In New York City you have the city that never sleeps a global economic driving force. As a result people in the more rural parts of New York face harsh taxes since these people make up a majority of the state. By isolating the people of the southern region the northerners would pay reasonable taxes while the southerners would pay appropriate taxes. Those who cant afford it or those who choose to pay lower taxes may want to move to the northern state. I believe that the northern regions economy could be managed with the help of metropolitan areas such as Albany Syracuse Utica Buffalo and Ithaca. There are also many universities in these areas many public schools and more than enough private schools that would continue to stimulate the economy. The southern region would have no problem sustaining itself.

Rain on a wedding day would be an example of situational irony because many women plan their weddings meticulously and have an expectation of control. Morisette is accessing the culturally shared vision of the woman who has been planning a wedding since she was a little girl. The rain shows what little control we actually have and exposes how our expectations do not meet reality. The guy who is in the plane crash says well isnt this nice verbal irony. Also he has a reasonable expectation that his plane would not crash because that is a very rare occurrence and it is the first plane trip he ever went on but it crashed creating a mismatch between expectation and reality situational irony. I suppose the man expected the plane to crash because of his fear of flying so it is not ironic for him but the characters around the man probably expected that he would end up somewhere safe. A traffic jam when you are already late is not very ironic I guess. spoons when all you need is a knife creates the image of a person going through a collection of flatware thinking that eventually there will be a knife. the expectation that a huge collection of flatware would have more than just spoons seems reasonable but that expectation is challenged by reality situational irony. The free ride when you have already paid is also ironic because winning anything beats the expectation of not winning already expressed by the characters buying of one ride situational irony. Meeting the man of your dreams accesses a shared and unrealistic but nonetheless present movie magic fantasy of falling in love. This expectation is immediately crushed when you meet his beautiful wife. This is cosmic or situational irony. The idea that you are an important part of the universe and you have a fate or destiny that is significant is pervasive. When the universe torpedoes that expected reality you have cosmic irony.The most common rebuttal I am familiar with is that her examples are more about bad timing or bad luck. To that I say that there are many instances of bad timing or bad luck that create ironic situations. Irony timing and luck are not mutually exclusive factors in any described event.A less common rebuttal I hear is that I am seeing more than what is there. According to this argument irony must be tacky and cranked up to eleven. I disagree. Subtle irony is irony too. Also literary analysis through describing imagery is acceptable in both prose and poetry. I feel that Morissette was unfairly criticized because of her gender age and medium pop music.The final rebuttal I am familiar with is that Morissette agreed with many of these criticisms and defended herself by admitting that she did not understand irony that well. Her admission needs to be taken into context. It was made after many intellectuals tore her song a new one.

I think its lazy and discouraging.',\n  'argument': 'Hey guys.So first of all I wouldnt go as far as to say that I think the term overrated is meaningless. I think I understand exactly what people mean when they say it. I just dont personally find myself using it or thinking of something as being overrated because of the way that I think about art and media and I wish more people could see things the way I do. But Im looking for someone to shed some light on what they think overrated means because maybe Im taking it to an extreme that others are not. What I mean is generally when people say something is overrated they mean this is critically acclaimed or appreciated by a huge number of people but I dont like it. Therefore I dont understand why so many people like it or I do not think it deserves the praise it gets.I personally do not believe in superlatives or assigning greatness to something that is purely subjective. I am a huge movie buff as some of you might know but I dont have a personal list of greatest movies because I dont think you can rank movies based on which is best since everyone has different criteria. However if you asked me what the greatest movie ever is I might say VERTIGO or CITIZEN KANE because there is a consensus among critics that it is either one of those two movies. Therefore when I say VERTIGO is the greatest I am NOT stating an opinion I am referring to the consensus of the canon of film criticism. I think greatest in these sense refers to most influential or most written about or most often said to be the best by people who are in the business of saying such things in which case greatest film could be an objective label because I think influence and popularity are objective qualities as opposed to the subjective act of enjoying something. I dont think there is necessarily one film that is MOST influential but it is inarguable that some films are just more influential than others.Lets move on to the Beatles we all know that time and time again on itll come up that someone thinks the Beatles are overrated. I think based on my criteria for greatness the Beatles are certainly great. It is hard to ignore the impact they had on pop culture and pop music and they are undeniably legendary and wellcited in literature and criticism and not without reason. When you say the Beatles are overrated youre saying either I dont like the greatest band of all time so how can they be the greatest? or because I dont like them they shouldnt have been the greatest band. The former statement is going against my own interpretation of what people mean by greatest as I said before. You are allowed to dislike the Beatles but still understand that they had this great impact. The second statement whether they deserved to have had that impact is prententiously insisting that your sole opinion is the only correct one. Rather than try to do research and understand the impact the Beatles had and figure out why they are called great you just kind of gave up and decided that you HAD to like them or they are automatically overrated.I think the problem is that people see things or listen to things called the greatest and assume it means that it is going to be the thing they enjoy the most. They hear that CITIZEN KANE is the greatest film of all time and think well that means that if I watch it I will have the most enjoyable experience I have ever had watching a movie. But CITIZEN KANE is considered great for reasons that are not readily apparent to the average modern viewer. Its basically the equivalent of a Chris Nolan film groundbreaking practical special effects yes theyre so good that I bet most of you are scratching your heads wondering what effects Im even referring to temporally complex narrative technical innovation incredible camerawork makeup and a young and spirited director at the helm. Its great in its historical context but its also great because critics decided it was great and it became a sort of cultural meme that everyone just assumes is true. If you wanted to say CITIZEN KANE is overrated because I have done extensive research and study and have written a peerreviewed critical analysis demonstrating how it did not really have the great influence and impact that it had something people have done then you would be going somewhere. But if you said CITIZEN KANE is overrated because I didnt like it you are misunderstanding what is meant by great and you are too lazy to do the research to see why it earns that label.Ultimately youre just missing out on a chance to enrich your cultural understanding and find out why things are beloved in their context even if you dont personally care for it. Personally I have never found a single thing to be overrated because even things I dislike I understand WHY they are liked and why they are influential because I am interested and invested in understanding popular culture. I know that not everyone is as into it as I am but if youre not why even make the criticism to begin with? And if youre posting to saying something is overrated because you want to understand it why not say I dont understand why people like this rather than make the presumptuous statement that implies other people are wrong for liking it? .'},\n {'id': 't3_2ao0uk',\n  'titles': 'Natural Rights do not exist.',\n  'argument': 'I believe natural rights i.e. ...those not contingent upon the laws customs or beliefs of any particular culture or government and therefore universal and inalienable... do not exist.I believe all rights given to any human are social constructs produced by society from moral structures determined by a multitude of factors.

I feel like Im going crazy here because I just realized that the sub has so many of the same qualities as rshitredditsays a sub that I really dislike. I want help to reconcile these differences. Some things I noticed Hyperbole and misrepresentation. Obviously its a circlejerk sub but I really feel like people there actually believe what they say about what feminists believe. I lurk rfemradebates a lot and have learned a lot about both MRM and feminism there and have noticed a huge disconnect between whats said there and what people circlejerk about in TiA. What TiA says about feminists is like what SRS says about MRAs. Outrage culture. Its been getting really bad there lately.. it used to be pretty chill but people are getting so angry and worked up that it feels really toxic now. I browse rtiadiscussion and a lot of people seem to agree. There was even a sticky mod post about how to deal with rage... Missing sarcasmobvious jokes and circlejerking about the opposition anyways. SRS does this a lot with regards to MRAs and they get a lot of flak rightfully for it. But then I see things like this on the front page of TiA and am starting to think that you can post almost anything fake from Tumblr to circlejerk about. Starting to attract actual bigots. SRS can get really bad with the actual communists eg. MaoStalin apologists and that sucks. Im a Muslim and I really hate how Tumblr tries to speak on our behalf but I hate Islamophobes way more. Threads like this were really disheartening to me especially because the article itself was so sensationalist and pretty much made shit up. I had the OP of that thread tagged as an Islamophobic white nationalist before so it sucks to see that actual bigots can get away with using the sub as a political soapbox. Plus the whole chan vs. Tumblr thing showed that there were a lot of chan.orgpol users there.. a place thats legitimately fucked up. Touching the poop. SRS likes to see themselves as the white knights of reddit who like to call out reddit but TiA is starting to act like ShitTumblrSays more and more. Its supposed to be a humor sub not the sub that keeps watch over the shit that Tumblrinas say. This one feels so weird... people are even starting to act like the Tumblr police thats just what SRS likes to do too when they cry to the reddit admins??? This last one is really petty but I feel like the cult of personality around the mods has been getting a bit over the top. The mods of TiA are treated like the archangelles of SRS... its really weird to me. I thought about this for awhile and I first thought that one major difference between the two subreddits is that TiA doesnt ban anybody with a different opinion like SRS does. But when I thought about it some more I realized that since SRS is so unpopular and TiA is so popular that TiA doesnt need any mod enforcement to make the sub a circlejerk. I remember seeing someone try to support Affirmative Action on the sub and they got hammered with downvotes even when they were being completely reasonable. this part made the thread go in a direction i didnt care about so Im removing ittldr Im starting to dislike TiA because its become like a mirror of rshitredditsays.

While I agree that it is only natural to want land back that was taken forcibly from you it seems that supporters of Palestine dont understand that dissolving an entire nation and its citizens for the sake of a historical grudge just cant happen in this modern world. Yes it was terrible how the land was taken from them but as so many others have pointed out it was also terrible how the land was taken from the native Americans yet surely everyone understands the issues that would arise if the entire continent was suddenly given back to native Americans. Instead Palestine seems to be getting enormous support from much of the world in their plight to sacrifice millions of lives in this bid to reclaim what they feel is theirs. If the identity of an entire states citizens is taken away from them resulting in more violence and refugees so that Palestine gets some land back so be it right?I want to side with Palestine given the continually dire situation they are in and the amount of oppression they are subjected to but this is all created by a war that seems entirely motivated by their own people.

For example sexism or the notion that women have no place in the public sectors of business and government and racism or the idea that different people are automatically born to menial positions in society because of the color of their skin. Just in very recent years people have finally begun getting past homophobia or the notion that gay lesbian and transgender people should be denied rights and considerations which heterosexual people take for granted. But one area where oldfashioned social taboos are still relatively untouched is the area of dress codes. We judge one another based on how we dress and we do so for the stupidest reasons. As the wiki explains That doesnt tell you the half of it. Judgments about clothing are inflexible and automatic with no appeal. For instance if I were to go into work next week and announce that I have decided that I am a woman I am a man my colleagues would be supportive enthusiastic and curious. However if I came to work wearing a dashiki and a kufi they would assume I had lost my mind. If I came to work wearing a cape underwear and cowboy boots I might face termination. The consequences of stepping outside accepted dress codes can be severe and nobody thinks twice about the prejudices and odd assumptions that underlie our attitudes about clothing. In certain fields for example business and law failure of men to wear the standard western business suit or women to wear the Condoleezastyle western pantsuit can have dire if unofficial consequences. However talented or hardworking or good at your job you might be you can quickly find yourself essentially ostracized disrespected by your employers clients and colleagues mocked and driven out of the profession. Almost exactly like a termite with foreign pheromones your colleagues will turn on you and eat you alive. For fun heres the famous scene in American Psycho that brilliantly satirizes our obsession with dress and dress codes. TLDR for all of western cultures progress in terms of getting rid of old prejudices western dress codes are almost absurdly driven by social prejudice and fear of what is strange unusual or different.

Even after we have been informed about the candidates running we are forced as a nation to come together and debate for ourselves what we think about the information given. If politicians and their staff were to instead talk directly to the people through forums such as AMAs then we could essentially cut out speculation and hear what we are voting for directly from the mouths of the politicians themselves.The first thing that comes to mind might be millions of people collecting to forums would take an excessive amount of resources to cater to.Yes that is true. It is hard to imagine a single staff working for a politician to be able to cater to the demand of people inquiring. However if the money spent on ad campaigns was instead directed to hiring staff members to speak on the politicians behalf then they could essentially train and employ enough people to take a huge chunk of the inquiries being thrown at them.

In any case those threads are dead and difficult to revive. There are new points that I would like to bring up.For the most part this concept is only discussed in politics but I would like to shift the discussion away from politics as much as possible. I think this problem exists in social media on a complicated level that we havent fully defined yet. I really hope someone here is able to put what I am attempting to describe in better words than I can or help me understand if Im missing something. The definition of satire is the use of humor irony exaggeration or ridicule to expose and criticize peoples stupidity or vices particularly in the context of contemporary politics and other topical issues.TV shows such as SNL The Colbert Report and South Park use excessive satire usually to prove a point that is part of the creators belief system. Let me point out that satire is a beautiful thing that helps us understand others beliefs in an entertaining way but I think it has gotten to a point where it is more damaging than progressive.TV shows like South Park and The Daily Show have been on air for nearly years. Children of the late s and early s have been subjected to heavy amounts of satire from childhood and into adulthood. As a result I believe that satire has become so heavily ingrained into the brains of emerging adults that it is having very negative sideeffects.These sideeffects are making it cool to hate. I see so many examples of this throughout social media. For some reason and I dont know why it is considered cool to hate the actor Nicolas Cage. Through social media and online memes these strange ideas have spread. Suddenly many people of the younger generation decide to bash Nicolas Cage and claim he is a terrible actor with complete ignorance or reasoning. We see the same thing happen with many other celebrities as well.But okay Nic Cage is just a celebrity and it shouldnt matter right? But I cant help but see this blind hate emerging everywhere. It extends itself to stereotypes as well and this is where I draw the line. I believe it has gotten to the point where it becomes cool to hate women. It becomes cool to hate hipsters. It even becomes cool to hate different websites such as Facebook Reddit or Twitter. The reason I believe this is a problem is because it promotes a lot of ignorant and aimless negative thought. And I understand that it has always been cool to hate in one form or another but nowadays we are subjected to it in our Facebook feeds on our mobile phones in our music everywhere. This hate surrounds us so much that it becomes such a normal part of our day and is accepted as okay.The worst part about it all is that it doesnt promote healthy and thoughtful discussion. If someone is accused of satirical slander its easy for the accuser to avoid defending themselves by ridiculing or saying its only a joke calm down. There is truth in all jokes and I dont think it should be taken lightly in the world we live in today.Satire is manipulating truthful original and thoughtful discussion.

Some employers will have a PTO bank for vacation days another one for sick days another one for personal days and another for floating holidays. Theres a lot of reasons I think this is worse than using a single combined PTO bank. The employee will have trouble calculating how much time is available to them. If the employer requires PTO to be used in hour chunks the actual amount of PTO available may be different from the useable amount of PTO available. Accounting on the employer side is complicated as there are going to be multiple ways of accounting for an employees day off. The various PTO banks usually accrue at different rates which makes it hard to estimate how much time off you will have in the future. The various PTO banks usually have different rules for how much time can be accumulated and whether or not it rolls over from year to year as well as how much can roll over each year. It encourages employees to lie which is bad for employee morale and bad for the company. Its better to know Fred will not be in a week ahead of time than for him to fake sick the morning of.

I once was offered to leave a job with weeks PTO all one bank for a job with weeks PTO week vacation weeks sick and the recruiter tried to claim that it was just a semantic difference.

If they were they wouldnt be oppressors Feminist activists should take whats rightfully theirs instead of waiting for it to be handed over to them Youre better off berating someone who practices intolerance to express the seriousness of what theyve done Criticizing an intolerant persons character might make them reconsider their positions Activists have been trying to educate for a long time and the hate is still flowingTLDR What serves modern movements like the fights for womens and minority rights better the approach of MLK or that of Malcolm X?'},\n {'id': 't3_2a2ccx',\n  'titles': 'Politicians should not be allowed to campaign through cold calls',\n  'argument': 'I will explain in anecdotal format how I came to this conclusionI was in my companys office and was called by a restricted phone number and answered accordingly due to the fact that it could have been important.

Weve been looking through the guest list and noticed that some family members and friends are homosexual a couple of lesbians and a gay. We are both atheists and hold no religious views whatsoever however I have always firmly held the belief that marriage is something that celebrates heterosexual partnership and I would be extremely uncomfortable seeing menwomen dancingkissing people of the same sex at the wedding. There is also the problem that one of these people is single and like to try and seduce other women. Im not sure how to deal with her as this would cause great disapproval from both sides of the family and potentially alienate us from family members.Im also worried that family members would think our wedding was a shambles for having them invited in the first place.My SO and I have already made the decision that we arent going to be inviting any homosexual partners as we dont want them to be a part of the wedding. But Im still very unsure about the remaining homosexuals...Anyone care to weigh in?My main concerns are That Im worried because these individuals are heavily into gay culture that they will act very gay and almost make the whole wedding about them being gays at a straight wedding look at us. and That because of the above my family members wont remember my and my fiances special day as a wonderful memory to be cherished but a shambles thats best left forgotten shame on ILikeFoodLots for letting his wedding go on this way...

TLDR Be a little patient the worlds not gonna end people will INEVITABLY stand up to this practice of destroying our privacy and invading our lives. Its only a matter of time. Sorry for the text wall. Well let me add a caveat to my original statement. What I was trying to say was that it would be a much bigger deal if they were using this on a large scale to effectively entrap an average citizen.Just from the information in this article it appears that they are using this for pretty serious crimes like very large smuggling operations of guns and drugs. And while I personally still dont find this to be entirely kosher its also not a surprise. If they were for example using this to profile an average person like you or me and then trying to entice us to commit crimes that we wouldnt normally commit I would have a much bigger problem with it. That would be entrapment. But here were talking about people who are KNOWN to be committing serious and sometimes violent crimes on a regular basis and theyre using the information to help catch them in the act.I tend to agree with this sentiment and I am fully aware that this is the start of a very slippery slope which could EASILY turn towards using it against people who havent actually committed a crime yet in a sort of Minority Report precognitive way. And even more conspiratorial I can imagine this becoming a tool in societal engineering in the sense that it could be used to stop political movements before they start. But I am not convinced that this is actually happening... YET.So back to the original post concerning why people dont already massively protest this... its because this is a very grey area that many people wouldnt have a problem with even if they knew for a fact that it was happening. As I said in another comment this system still requires them to find traditionally admissible evidence with a warrant they still have to do the grunt work after this guides them to the honey jar.I see some possible futures when it comes to the whole topic of secret surveillance in general.. they get greedy use this on lesser and lesser crimes and it eventually becomes so widely known that people become scared that its not just drug dealers and gun runners anymore. This sparks more widespread outcries and activism and the public finally denounces it forcing its power to be restricted or revoked.. Law enforcement attempts to make this sort of evidence admissible in court publicly a national debate ensues and again the power of warrantless information is legally neutered due to public pressure.Either of these paths could end in two ways peacefully or violently as in notso peaceful protests BUT I simply do not believe that the citizens of the United States or any other country will somehow continue to allow this to progress out of complacency or some crap like that. Take the civil rights movement for example. The things that instigated the massive protests to end racial segregation were not small events they were events that affected thousands of black people. People could SEE everyday that there were two bathrooms for blacks and whites that they werent allowed to get an education that they were physically beaten and killed by police and even civilians and that they were loudly and unsympathetically abused verbally all occurring over the course of years and years. It wasnt like one day everyone just said ok enough today were gonna end racism... it was a slow buildup of events and the voicing of opinions by MLK and hundreds of other social leaders that created an eloquent logical AND emotional foundation which opposed the discrimination that was occurring. They provided the guidance of why it was wrong why the general public was REQUIRED to force a change and gave them the belief that they COULD change it. Now look at the surveillance issue. There has really only been one major event that was on par with something like a mass hanging or seeing someone beat to death and dragged behind a truck and that was the revelation of all the documents from WikileaksSnowden. That was the point at which the public at large became initially AWARE at all that this was even occurring while previously it would have sounded like every other conspiracy theory. At that point we had ground to stand on because we had hard evidence of this illegal and morally objectionable practice. Sure its been going on for a long time and many people have KNOWN that... but there was really no evidence to back it up previously. No one had been illegally detained referring to Manning no one had been forced to flee the country for being a whistleblower Julian AssangeEd Snowden. Now these things have been harped on by media outlets for YEARS. People have been forced now to put thought into it and we are starting to build a community of LEADERS who serve to maintain awareness and build confidence that something can be done about it.I know that this is long winded but I think its important to contextualize what is going on by comparing it to previous issues that are somewhat similar. Three MAJOR societal leaders who were respected and outspoken were ASSASSINATED and this was after about years of the unrest building and building. Unfortunately this is what will most likely have to happen or something on this scale before real change occurs. I would love if massive political upheaval were quicker and easier to effect but... its just not how it works.It WILL happen eventually and many terrible things will likely be perpetrated when it comes to the surveillance state but we are really at the whim of inciting incidents to help motivate the citizenry. Without something to point at and a powerful relatable leader like JFK or MLK to push the issue into the collective consciousness of the people we will not see the major changes we are hoping for.Assange Snowden and Manning started this thing but they with all due respect are not in a position to do what needs to be done beyond what theyve already accomplished. They cant tour the country giving powerful speeches they are not generally viewed as charismatic people and they arent even in the country anyway. Occupy wall street failed because they didnt have strong leaders going for them. JFK was the PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES MLK was a reverend and a speaker on par with the very best. Both revered members of society in the eyes of the general public. I cant think of a single person who fits that bill in the present day. Obama is clearly not that person in fact no politicians at all could hope to fill those shoes. I dont know who COULD live up to that challenge but it will happen. Something reprehensible will inevitably occur perpetrated by the NSALaw Enforcement and it will be the tipping point leaders will emerge naturally and organically. More and more ordinary people will start to be NOTICEABLY affected by this surveillance and the wave will break as it always has and always will. I am not worried at all that this apocalyptic Orwellian nightmare will ever even come to pass. If it does it will be quite short lived and met with the wrath of millions of people who simply wont accept it.If you read all that then I TRULY appreciate it I am very passionate about this topic and I only want to serve to provide a bit of confidence to people who are afraid that this will simply become the norm and well all just have to grin and bear it.

I am neither for nor against the motion of Christian propaganda.With that being said I have meditated and experienced first hand the effects a large gathering of Christians can have on the mindset of a person without a belief system.After visiting a couple church sermons I am amazed at how fast a church is capable of taking someone with a completely opposite mindset and conforming them instantly within a couple sermons. I am even more astounded by how fast churches are capable of taking children and within a week theyve got the child radically supporting an adopted belief system.I thought to myself Either Christianity is so true that a good preacher can convert masses out of how obvious the belief system is or there is some sort of fallacy going on here.Heres what might be happeningTake this first set of statements. God exists God doesnt existRationally the average person should be able to live their life with an opinion that both possible statements exist as equally as each other even though their contradictory.However the statements are usually phrased like this. God exists. He is all loving all powerful and he is governing the universe with his sense of perfection.There is no god. There is no perfect allpowerful loving being protecting us from harm. The world is not perfect.Even though both those statements have an equal value of being true if we believe that the world is governed by a perfect loving supreme being we would feel a lot happier.Therefore before anyone even enters a church they are already primed to want to believe one statement over the other even though they know rationally that both statements are equal in value.Its a positive outlook bias that our brain performs in order to lead our minds into believing things that make us feel good inside.Now lets look at these statements When we die we are reborn and live eternally. When we die nothing happens.The first statement makes you feel better therefore youre more likely to believe it.What happens after that is the church plays on anticipation. When we die we go to Heaven where we are blissfully happy and reunited with our loved ones. When we die nothing happens.In the first statement you have something to look forward to. In the second statement you have nothing to look forward to.This is the same as flipping a coin and getting a hundred bucks if it lands on heads. Even though you know rationally that either possibility is just as likely the other you want to believe more that the coin is going to land on heads.So is the church converting massive amounts of people weekly because Christianity is so obviously true?

The person doesnt have an infection in the way we use the term colloquially as though a little pus is forming in a wound but a communicable disease that is highly dangerous. Doctors offices universities health practitioners and so forth should continue using the term STD because it better conveys the conditions represented.'},\n {'id': 't3_29n4wo',\n  'titles': 'I dont think people should ever settle in relationships I dont think there is anything wrong in having high standards and I dont think there is such thing as a bad reason to break up with someone.',\n  'argument': 'Why I want this view changed? I feel about it pretty strongly and all of these are basically going against most relationship advice I hear that is considered mature while my mentality is often regarded as shallow or immature. I wand to understand better where the other side is coming from.Title explains it summed up here are my arguments and additional views that may be relevant. Relationship is not superior to being single and should not be searched for at all cost. Relationship should be wanted only when there is a person you want to be in a relationship with.. You either want someone or you dont. You are either attracted to them or you arent. They can be nice and compatible but if they arent what you want there is no point in trying to make it work for the sake of being nice or fair. Relationships arent deserved.. Preferring physically attractive people does not make you shallow. In fact it is shallow to assume that relationships are so important that persons preferences in them determine their whole depth as human beings.. There is no objective measure as to what should or shouldnt be changed for the sake of your partner. You have to take the person for what they are and not imagine you will change them or compromise and change yourself for them unless it is a change you want to make yourself. For example it is considered unreasonable to expect your SO to stop talking to someone you dont like but it is reasonable to expect your SO to stop drinking every day. In my opinion no one owes their partner a change and no one owes a relationship you can leave over anything you dont like and you dont have to change anything you dont want to. BUT there should be no hard feelings because neither side is a bitch or a jerk for their choice. Its not a moral issue either.. No one owes a relationship. It is ok to only want sex with someone hot over wanting a relationship and looking for deeper things that isnt in any way a moral issue.. Standards arent objective even though many people might share the same standards. You dont have to give back everything you expect you simply have to know what you want and someone either fits or doesnt.. It is stupid that people get offended for not being someones type. You arent hurting anyone by not wanting to be with them over something even if they think the reason isnt fair. Relationships arent favors or rewards anyway. . There is no bad reason to end a relationship. I keep hearing people say how someone broke up with them over something dumb think of it the dumber the reason someone breaks up with you over the more it means that the relationship wasnt that important to them in the first place. Which means the break up was necessary even more so than when people in love break up over something big and understandable. . Being with someone or staying with someone you dont want the most is harming not only you but them as well. Someone might like them more than you do so committing yourself while not that attracted or for the sake of keeping the relationship effort was put in is in fact disrespectful to the other person. Therefore they should not get angry but understand the situation.However problem still is that these type of relationships may not be something many people can handle at least not at this point. But a lot about them makes so much sense to me that now I would change the focus of this view all together because it is only a little part of a much bigger problem underneath.'},\n {'id': 't3_29mv5t',\n  'titles': 'An antiabortion stance is not incompatible with either atheism or libertarianism.',\n  'argument': 'I am going to use the terms proabortion and antiabortion because prolife and prochoice are too loaded. Proabortion is short for in favor of the right to abort.For the record I am a socialist proabortion atheist. Although I disagree with the antiabortion view I dont think it has anything to do with religion or excessive government control.The chief antiabortion argument is that fetuses are alive. Whether life begins at conception weeks or whatever is not the point wherever you draw the line the motivation behind prohibiting abortion is to save lives.Some peoples beliefs about when life begins are determined by their religion. But I see no reason why religion should be the only determining factor. Unless you think its okay to kill newborns you cant criticize someone for wanting to protect a month fetus. And if months is reasonable why not ? And so on. The claim that atheists cant reach the same conclusions as Christians rests on the same logic as the claim that atheists cannot be moral.Libertarians and here I mean genuine libertarians and not Tea Party social conservatives can also be antiabortion without being hypocrites. Libertarians are not anarchists they believe there should be some laws in order to protect your basic rights just not too many. No right is more fundamental than life. So if a libertarian believes life begins at conception whether because of religious or other views it is fine for himher to want to outlaw abortion.Since I am neither libertarian nor antiabortion Im not particularly emotionally invested in this view so it shouldnt be too hard to change though I admit I can be stubborn sometimes.'},\n {'id': 't3_29kyod',\n  'titles': 'Compared to women men have noway less safe spaces and everything close to one is labeled as sexistexcluding women and is in the process of being taken away.',\n  'argument': 'To me it seems as if men have no safe spaces to talk to other men about things. Here are some things that I viewed as traditionally viewed as safe spaces for men Video games which were dominated by men for a while now have even genders overall in hard core games where women are a low percentage the gamer communitygames themselves are labeled as sexist. See Female character model controversies Mirrors Edge Assassins Creed etc. Jobs dominated by men engineering blue collar jobs etc. are being encouraged more and more for females to join. At the same time society is essentially calling these jobscompanies sexist because of the low percentages of women which has resulted in lots of companies pushing hard for more women in the work place. Domestic shelters are dominated in numbers by women with few shelters being available for men. Websites on the internet like reddit have the communities called sexist all the time and even now we are seeing a constant push towards making reddit more female friendly see twoxchromosomes becoming a default subreddit and pushing aside the male demographic.Anyway the result of all of this is I think that men essentially have limitedno avenues for places to talk to other men where as women have a plethora of places that they can go to.

I dont do this to make a point but just because I am in the USA and thats how we generally refer to the sports here. Were I in the UK I would definitely say American Football and Football.To give you some perspective I am a football NFL fan and in the past year I got much more into watching the games. I really enjoy watching football. When I was able to I watched some of the World Cup games and I did enjoy watching them but the whole time I just wished I was watching football. Just to clarify I really hope someone can change my mind because I really enjoy watching football and I would love to be able to enjoy watching soccer as well! I feel like theres more of a global following for soccer and that might have some fun implications.That said Ill get into itThings that bug me about watching soccer In football people often slam into each other at full speed. In soccer it seems to me that any accidental unavoidable contact results in a penalty. The penalty at the end of the Netherlands Mexico game basically completely decided the game and as I recall it didnt seem at least to me that it was intentional. As I recall it was almost unavoidable but it decided the entire game! One guy was trying to kick the ball another guy was near him and their legs touched and thats the game! It was so unsatisfying. If penalties arent being called on the players it seems to me like the players are constantly desperately trying to get the refs to call penalties. It seems like every time two people come within a couple of inches of each other one of them intentionally falls down looks at the ref angrily sometimes pretends to hold their leg in pain and in the case where a penalty isnt called gets up and continues playing as if nothing happened in other words they were obviously faking an injury. You can watch a game go on for minutes and have nothing happen at all then sneeze and miss a goal. At least in football you know when a play is going to start so you know when you have to pay rapt attention. In soccer it seems like you have to stare at the screen for minutes straight for fear of missing a goal. The penalty shootout feels like a copout. I know it isnt realistic to just keep playing for forever but I was really rooting for Chile and I was really bummed at how they got knocked out.Things that I like about watching soccer Fewer commercial breaks. I really do appreciate this although it goes hand in hand with above. Global community. In football the Philadelphia Eagles is just as likely to have someone from Texas or Alabama or Oklahoma as Philadelphia. In soccer I really enjoyed watching the players get tearful as they sang their National Anthems. So awesome! Although I do think the penalty shootouts are a bit of a copout while watching Chile and Brazils shootout as well as Costa Rica and Greece I was definitely enjoying myself and on the edge of my seat. On one hand it is sort of a copout but on the other hand it is similar to a game being won by a field goal at the end of a football game.Things I like about football which are absent in soccer I feel like football has more structure. Theres more room for strategy there is more variability between the positions and theres a variety of different plays screen pass ground attack long bomb short pass play action etc. It may be that soccer has similar strategy and I just dont know about it. Further football seems to have better time management. Theres time outs quarters time stops on a missed pass or an injury as opposed to soccer where time never stops and the refs just add some random amount of time to the clock when the half is over. Theres more variety. Like I said different plays different skill sets for different players touchdowns field goals passing running punting etc. In soccer theres only a goal which brings me to my next point Theres so much action! In football an interception or a completed pass is exciting. In soccer both of those things seem to happen every seconds. In football a game where one team scored once or zero times and the other team scored two or less times would be a pretty boring game. In soccer and seem to be pretty common scores.So please ! I would really love to get more into soccer because I really enjoyed getting into football this last season. Ive already got my hierarchy of teams I want to win planned out GO USA! Then Costa Rica! Then Germany! Then Belgium! Then Netherlands!E Thanks to everyone for commenting! At this point all but one of my views have been changed and Ive bolded that above. The general take away from this as far as I can tell is A I need to learn more of the rules of soccer B I need to stop trying to watch soccer as if its football and instead watch it like its soccer.Thanks again!'},\n {'id': 't3_29gpjt',\n  'titles': 'I think that people who have racial fetishes especially toward Asian or black people are disturbing.',\n  'argument': 'Ive noticed that there are a lot of guys specifically people who are NOT Asian who have yellow fever.

Ordinarily this would be fine and I think it is for the most part effective against ordinary criminals who are easily contained. When we consider supervillains we consistently see that they either break free of capture or avoid getting captured in the first place. These villains often go on to pursue other schemes that result in significant harm or death to innocent civilians. If thats the case then it would be better for heroes to apply lethal force in order to prevent villains from escaping and endangering more lives. Note that this does not always entail killing. A hero would not be justified in killing a villain if merely handicapping that villain would be equally or more effective at preventing harm. My basic argument boils down to. It is justified to use the minimal amount of force necessary to safely prevent a person from infringing on others rights provided that the minimal amount is still reasonably proportional to the crime that would be committed We would permit a John to kill Jack if it was necessary in order to prevent Jack from killing another person but would not allow John to kill Jack if it were the minimal amount of force necessary to prevent him from stealing .. Supervillains often commit crimes that result in numerous deaths or at the very least a significant amount of danger to the lives of innocent people. . Crimes that result in numerous deaths or at the very least a significant amount of danger to the lives of innocent people warrant the criminal being killed if necessary.. Thus the crimes that supervillains commit warrant them being killed if it is necessary.. Killing or handicapping a supervillain is the minimal amount of force to subdue them as capture is not an option.C. Killing or handicapping a supervillain is morally permissible obligatory if you think superheroes have a moral obligation to stop villains.TLDR Killing or handicapping prevents villains from infringing on others rights better than simple capture does so superheroes should use those means.Extra note I bring up killing because for certain varieties of villains such as psychic villains like Psimon magic villains like Loki or smart villains like Lex Luthor cannot have their relevant abilities handicapped without doing something that is probably about as bad as killing them granted I dont know enough about superhero universes to know if there are ways to disable these abilities.'},\n {'id': 't3_29c3ml',\n  'titles': 'I dont find anthropogenic global warming an interesting issue.',\n  'argument': 'I have never really been interested in the whole manmade global warming issue.

All these things would be much cheaper if their prices werent artificially inflated by the unnecessary involvement of insurance companies.Health insurance should be like all other kinds of insurance It should only cover costs that are prohibitively expensive urgently needed and difficult to predict needing in advance. You dont use homeowners insurance to fix a broken window or use car insurance to get an oil change. So thats my broad reason for being against health insurance covering birth control and incidentally Viagra too.But I would go even further to argue that birth control especially doesnt belong in health insurance policies even compared to Viagra. And the reason is simple Birth control is not medicine. It doesnt treat an affliction. Rather it just helps women manage their risk of pregnancy. But there are other ways to do that condoms pulling out avoiding sex for the few days around ovulation or entirely. I understand that its deeply important to women to avoid unwanted pregnancies but that doesnt justify extending the concept of healthcare to birth control. Again its just not medicine. One way to change my view would be to convince me that putting birth control on insurance policies would increase womens overall access to it. Most people take this as a given but its far from obvious to me. of products are bought and sold directly between the consumer and the provider without insurance companies in the middle.

Yes I know there are work arounds such as changing settings and uninstalling when expired but this isnt the point. Besides sometimes this wont even work.

I love the internet.

They start downvoteupvote brigades. I dont know a single political philosophy that isnt guilty of this shoving their opinion down peoples throats instead of having a nuanced thoughtful discussion which is willing to take critique of their views. Seriously I may be a liberal but god damn are liberals just as bad as conservatives. Dont let anyone tell you different. Its bullshit and they know it.I know the internet has brought us so many positive things in the modern world but it has taught us to seek out people to be involved with in our lives based on criteria that we dictate. A few decades ago we would have to learn good social skills to be able to connect with people who werent exactly like us. Does that mean we had to agree with them on every issue? No. Does that mean there werent still people who were total assholes? No. What it does mean though is that we have severely limited ourselves and our social ability to communicate effectively with people we might not agree with on every issue.

Some may argue that Africa should not be annihilated because killing is wrong. This is a shortsighted view. If killing is wrong annihilating Africa would reduce killing longterm. The amount of people being killed in wars famines and plagues would plummet. Killing would ultimately be prevented by preventing people from being born.. The amount of suffering caused by killing is not proportional to the number of people killed. If a random person is murdered their friends and relatives will become saddened because of it.

You dont need that salary! Im not going to donate to a charity just so you can have a villa in Tuscany!Theyre missing the point though. If the charities want to do a good job they need talented dedicated people to lead them. Talented dedicated people are not common and therefore command a higher than average salary. The kind of person who commands probably brings a marginal benefit worth much more than over the kind of person who commands . From this point of view it only makes sense that the charities invest in a highly paid executive figuring that they gain more than they lose by spending the extra money.Of course this is a different matter from people who embezzle money from charities and if you give the charity the benefit of the doubt they dont spend a year on a year talent except by mistake.To conclude Id like to counter one probable argument which is that the talented dedicated people who can get a large salary from a charity should be willing to forego that large salary for the good of the cause.

He admitted to being an armed guard at Auschwitz and allegedly he was also a volunteer and member of the SS. Each count is linked to a trainload of victims brought to the death camp while he worked there.I do not know whether this particular man is guilty nor his current political beliefs. However I maintain that even if he has been a Nazi sympathizer his whole life even if he has no regrets about his past and even if he was a willing participant in all those murders he should not be arrested for this crime.The man in question was years old when Auschwitz was liberated and only at the time of the crimes cited by the German warrant. He had volunteered at the age of . Im sure no one here was complicit in genocide at that age but nonetheless we all made mistakes when we were younger. The difference is Breyer lived in a time when the potential impact of youthful mistakes was much greater. The Nazi regime deliberately appropriated the folly of youth for its own means and even the most ideological year olds were simply pawns in the Holocaust.Statutes of limitations are generally accepted as an important element of modern justice. While there may not be a legal limit when it comes to crimes like murder I believe there should be. I dont know what the cutoff point should be but surely years is too much. years ago is history and as any historian will tell you we cannot judge the actions and beliefs of remote historical periods based on modern standards. Maybe we can judge political leaders but not everyday citizens.The fact is death camps were legal in Nazi Germany. The actions committed there were legally sanctioned violence. There are plenty of examples of otherwise criminal actions legally permitted in modern society. For example what if years from now we decided to prosecute anyone who contributed to global warming? We might be justified in blaming political leaders who set policies that allowed corporations to pollute and we might even be justified in blaming corporate executives who destroyed our environment for their own gain but could we prosecute a factory worker?Breyer was years old when Hitler came to power. He was when WWII officially began. It is simply impossible to judge someone raised in that environment using modern liberal democratic standards. The Nazi regime was designed to brainwash children into total loyalty and enthusiastic support for its evil ideals. Maybe we can judge people who were older and wiser but a child raised in the Third Reich deserves leniency.The most important question in my mind is what does anyone gain by prosecuting Johann Breyer? Yes some of his victims are still alive and of course it is difficult to assign any benefit to a murder trial since the real victims cannot receive any recompense for their suffering. However a death sentence would be excessive and life in prison relatively meaningless for such an old man. It seems obvious that the real function of a trial like this is to reduce German societys guilt to a single individual and punish him in order to lighten its own conscience. Breyer was not a politician or other public figure he was a worker. The only reason to target Breyer is because he coincidentally is one of the last Nazi criminals left alive if Hitler was still alive to be prosecuted Breyer would never have been arrested.I personally believe in modern German collective guilt. It is healthy for a whole country to recognize and regret its past regardless of whether individuals were participants or even alive at the time. In the same way English people have to atone for th century colonialism and Americans should express remorse for the genocide of Native Americans in fact this has not been emphasized enough but thats a discussion for another time. However these are historical facts for which no single individual can be held to account. If a living individual could be blamed it would only detract from the necessary collective guilt. Society needs to learn from its mistakes not externalize its guilt onto a single person.Was Breyer only following orders as many Nazis claimed? Even if he was following orders does that make his crimes any less? I dont know the answers to these questions but I believe that they are questions for historians and philosophers rather than lawyers and judges.TLDR Regardless of his actual guilt Auschwitz guard Johann Breyer should not have been arrested because He was the product of an evil society that brainwashed his generation At the time of his crimes he was barely old enough to be considered a legal adult and minors are less culpable than adults All crimes should have a statute of limitations His crimes should be judged in a different historical context because they were part of a different society His prosecution is only a way for modern society to feel better about itself by punishing an arbitrary individual'},\n {'id': 't3_28kmxf',\n  'titles': 'There is no reason for me to oppose sweatshop labor in third world countries',\n  'argument': 'Alright so its obviously wellknown that a lot of major Western corporations produce their products in third world factories with terrible working conditions hours and wages.

To elucidate my point there is a map by a reporter named Colin Woodward that expresses the kind of cultural and political divisions Im talking about It would be very helpful to at least look at the maps on the link before responding.I believe that it would be ideal that these U.S. Nations or culturally independent regions in fact become independent and form their own independent governments. I feel this would benefit their populations in the following ways . It would allow for these governments to address individual problems more effectively as the problems effecting each region are quite different. The inference being that the population of a cultural group knows best how to address those problems. . It would foster more effective democracies since the will of the people to enact their own legislation would not be bogged down in the wash of so many other groups interest as the situation currently is in D.C.. Since legislation would be more easily passed it would give people the empowering feeling brought about by selfdetermination and make the populations of these regions ultimately happier.. If those countries continued to have governments with representatives it would be easier to effect the political process since considering reductions of scale talking to your local or state representative would have a more powerful impact on the laws actually passed.Now let me consider objections that I anticipate. For those of you that say that for some of these regions there is a history of human rights or social justice problems that are only properly addressed by a larger central government I dont entirely disagree with you and I wont say that youre wrong or that no intervention is necessary by the more socially enlightened cultural group. What I will say is that the situation is analogous to although in a slightly less extreme way than the U.S. interfering in the affairs of other countries like for instance Pakistan. It seems like the solutions that work to problems like these in the current global situation are diplomacy or sanctions not domination especially considering that the kinds of human rights problems that would arise if the U.S. split up today pale in comparison to many of the human rights issues faced in other countries that we would never consider nor should we consider invading. Again because we have seen that when we invade the country of a different cultural group and try to impose our own cultural regime it often has unforeseen consequences that members of the foreign cultural group are vlid to by virtue of their foreignness. The different cultural groups within the United States are more similar but still different enough for this problem to still arise albeit to a lesser degree.. For those of you that say a solution like this is impractical to implement given the current infrastructure of the country this is a valid objection but for the purposes of this discussion Id like to talk about what the ideal situation would be not the nitty gritty of how it would be implemented bureaucratically or technically. To you should tell me why this would not be the ideal situation should we be able to implement it successfully.. For those of you that say that creating new borders would cause a burden for travel and commerce given the creation of new international borders I can easily travel to another country now if I have a passport. And boarders have not posed much of an economic problem for current international companies that have aspects of their production and distribution processes scattered all over the globe. There may be a problem when it comes to moving to another state which would turn into immigration but I dont see this as a major issue. Again issues such as immigration are one of the things that these individual cultural cohorts should be able to selfdetermine.. For those of you that say The south already tried that and it didnt work out so well... I will say again that to you should not tell me why its impractical to implement given the current infrastructure of the country. Im only interested in why this would not be the ideal situation should we be able to implement it successfully.That being said please !This is exactly what I was doing. The problem is not necessarily that the country is too big but that the current electoral system does not do a very good job of adequately representing the will of the people and therefore in my mind violates the basic social contract that the government gets its authority to legislate by the consent of the governed. But it does not follow from that that the solution is to break up the country. It would be more reasonable to advocate for electoral reform.

This culture exists within the bounds of other cultures and should be celebrated and certainly not shunned. However if Queer people are equated with the heterosexual and cisgendered populations this culture is lost.For example one can observe the history of Native Americans.

Their histories have slowed significantly some even halting.

Despite this humanitys flawed understanding of science still produces reliable reproduceable data. God intentionally engineered the whole of creation to be utterly misleading when confronted with rational investigation. All of this was done as an implicit test of faith. It is implicit because the Bible never mentions any scientific topic as flawed meaning that this grand charade was created without a specific directive from God on how humanity should interpret it. The Devil has altered the whole of reality to reflect the above. This interpretation makes the Devil vastly more powerful than any interpretation I have seen.The alternative is to reconcile science and theology by simply acknowledging that God gave a figurative account of creation because He was speaking to humans who lacked even rudimentary understanding of science for whom complex topics like evolution and celestial mechanics would require thousands of years of discovery to even begin to comprehend.NOTE THE TITLE OF THIS POST.

Subjects such as genderspecific culture studies economics and sociology etc. are completely ideological.Your academic worth is decided by how closely your opinions reflect the approved view. This manifests itself differently in each country. For example in France leftist economists such as Piketty will be far more successful in academia. In all regions the subject matter is often dangerously unscientific. Even semiscientific disciplines such as linguistics are marred by ideologic cancer. Some subjects are intellectually worthless andor bullshit factories.The Sokal hoaxen.wikipedia.orgwikiSokalaffair is a good example of this. Basically nothing of cultural or practical value is produced. Sadly philosophy often falls victim to sterile debates of this sort are humans animals? What is art?The intellectual purity of mathematics and physics cannot be surpassed. Many problems outlined by philosophy can only be solved by modern science.Neurologists empiricists inventors can give actual solutions instead of spending their time making assumptions or formulating unverifiable hypotheses. There is no potential limit to what science can accomplish. Its entirely possible that conundrums such as free will can and will be solved soon. There is nothing a philosopher can do that a scientist cant. In fact the best philosophers tend to be scientists. Science is the only thing that has reliably brought solutions thus far. Even things such as largescale democracy are only the result of increased wealth caused by tech. The only long term changes brought upon humanity were the result of tech. The best students gravitate towards STEMThe humanities tend to attract bad students because the subjects are much easier and more open to interpretation whereas in science rigor and hard work cannot be escaped. I remember back in high school that the best science students were also the best at humanities. They had the most vocabulary and the most extensive cultural knowledge the best analytical skills and the best taste.There are way too many mediocre students in the humanities who end up never creating anything of value. Thats why humanities in college are a joke. People good at the humanities dont need to study them.Without art culture etc. life wouldnt be worth living. A world with only engineers would be a nightmare. However youd have to be naive to think that studiying humanities in college makes you talented. Great writers dont emerge because of shitty creative writing classes in college or english lit. Great painters dont need art history. Great thinkers manage on their own. Their talent is far beyond what can be taught in school. The production of culture is rarely the result of punctilious study.So far these are the conlusions Ive come to. Obviously being in STEM does not make you a genius but the basic point is that a humanities degree is much more likely to be worthless both practically and intellectually. Its more likely that a given student gravitated towards humanities out of laziness instead of interest.

As a result of this news some of my feminist formerfriends posted articles to this effect Im not going to weigh in on the truth of Ubisofts claims particularly whether or not their claims were justified or whether any of the views held by either side is right and just. The general consensus among the feminism crowd seemed to be along the lines that . There are many sexist stereotypes prevalent in video games possibly moreso in mainstream titles and particularly noticed by the feminists are those stereotypes concerning women. . There is a large and substantial base of female gamers many of whom would presumably enjoy games that break stereotypes and employ strong female lead characters . Many popular games today dont necessarily serve female gamers so wellIm not going to suggest that feminists shouldnt complain well I might a little but from my vantage point thats pretty much all I see get done. If you actually believe and above then there might be a GOLDEN MARKET OPPORTUNITY FOR YOU and you should invest your ranting energy into developing for this female gamer market its also overwhelmingly likely that this is in fact already being done and Im just not particularly aware of it. Barriers to entry have probably never been lower to go develop for almost any platform you like and indy games that hit it big have the opportunity to hit it REALLY big.

When I say they should have similar facilities I specifically mean Emergency Room with staff available to treat people with immediate concerns such as wanting to harm themselvesothers or extreme psychotic episodes. Mobile mental health ambulances who can respond quickly to emergencies like those previously mentioned and bring patients to the Mental Health Emergency Room if necessary. General practitioners who most people should see once or twice a year to check up and some may need to see a little more often when under particular distress Specialists who see patients regularly who have diagnosed chronic mental health issuesIt seems to me that the mental health world is predominantly specialists with general practitioners here and there. The only emergency staff tend to be at dedicated facilities where patients are committed. My friend with depressionselfharm issues explained that she didnt think her visits with counselorstherapists were particularly helpful because when she saw them was when she felt normal and not in the state of distress.While I pointed her toward hotlines it is extremely limited to how much you can help over the phone and often they only referred her to set up an appointment with a local professional in the next few weeks. While that is good it doesnt prevent her from selfharming in those emergency situations. I think having both ER and Ambulance type services for mental health would be extremely beneficial in these scenarios because they can provide care when it is most needed.I believe that having these facilities available would give people suffering from mental health issues a resource when they feel like they dont have anyone who can help them. Ultimately making these services available I think would make it less taboo to seek out mental health care and make it similar to regular health care.However I dont really have any firsthand experience with mental health care so Im open to change my mind.'},\n {'id': 't3_27tb09',\n  'titles': 'I should be allowed to play first person shooters when I am .',\n  'argument': 'Okay now this post is an issue I have been having lately with my Mom.

Since the invention of the internet many of the questions that we test become obsolete. For high school exams memorizing specific dates names functions etc. are fairly pointless when you could look it up in seconds. Even in university when writing essays becomes common producing an analysis of passages in such a short time and stressful environment is not an indication many times of how much one knows but often how much they have memorized what is mentioned in class. In particular computer science exams consisting of writing programs with no aid is extremely ineffective and does not examine how much one actually knows of a subject.I believe a much better assessment would be through the use of final assignments where students have a larger time in a less stressful environment. This allows access to all resources they would have in a job and allows for teachers to provide them with much more difficult and interesting problems than could be provided on a short exam. While it is true that there would be the tendency to copy other students such students likely will not make it into the job world simply relying on others.

Im not talking about paparazzi which in my opinion is closer to stalking or harassment. Im also not referring to government surveillance which can involve tracking or data collection beyond a simple photograph or video recording. Im specifically talking about a scenario like thisPerson A is walking in a public park with lots of people around. Person B is sitting on a park bench. Person A sees a bird in a tree heshe would like to photograph. This tree is directly behind the park bench person B is sitting on. Person A raises the camera to photograph the bird at which point person B objects to having their photo taken rather than simply obscuring their face or moving. Now I understand that it may make people uncomfortable knowing that they are the subject being captured on film but if you are willingly in a public place with many people around I feel that its understood that many pictures may be taken and that you may be in some of them. The idea that a photographer needs to ask permission from everyone that may be in any given picture is absurd. I say this from personal experience as well as other examples from around the web a good one being thisThis woman chose to go to a public place and was then offended when someone else at the public place had a camera. Never mind the assault charges I believe she had no right to confront the person about it.Essentially it boils down to a person attempting to deprive someone of the ability to photograph and observe freely simply because they are indirectly affected with no real harm done. Being photographed does not damage a person in any way other than possibly making them uncomfortable for a few minutes.

If we start with the assumptions that there are no greater beings which dictate the purpose of life or human existence and that the most powerful paradigm is the one which provides the most personal happiness while minimizing contradictions then it seems that a complete amorality is the strongest secular position. Ill use a simple example to explain why I think so A man is faced with the choice whether or not to gain and bring about the instant death of a random person he does not know. A moral man would be at a serious dilemma. He must choose between what he believes to be right protecting human life and his selfish desires to acquire money and in turn powerhappiness. The man must sacrifice either his own happiness or his moral principle at this juncture. An amoral man would not be at a loss he would not think twice about taking the money and would overall be happier with himself for doing so than the moral man. These points of cognitive dissonance are a serious hindrance to an individuals happiness. No one likes the feeling of choosing between one good thing and another. The person would prefer whether he knows it or not to receive one without knowledge of the other. Barry Schwartz talked about this in his book The Paradox of Choice. In the same respect an amoral man is happier with his life and his decisions than a moral man who frets over the best way to go about doing things and must worry about both his own selfish interests and his moral principles. I have come to believe this wholeheartedly but it seems to contradict with almost everyones point of view and Im not confident enough to assume Im right and seemingly the world is wrong. I dont ruthlessly pursue my own interests and in fact many people would consider me a good person. I often enjoy helping people I respect and care for even at great cost to myself and my circumstances allow me to live more comfortably within the bounds of the law than I would if I were to become a criminal. However I dont hold any moral principles. My only principle is to maximize my own enjoyment of life and if someone were to offer me the hypothetical briefcase without fear of the legal consequences I would probably take and sleep like a baby afterwards.

On top of that you have to deal with constant stress and possible violence from other inmates leaving you with emotional and perhaps physical scars. Once you do get out youre lost. You have no housing transportation insurance etc. More so technology has probably advanced so much you dont know how anything works anymore. Often you cant even get decent work due to a lack of skills andor discrimination. Sometimes your criminal record isnt even erased! Basically your life is ruined and youre wasting more of your life just catching up on everything you missed. Regardless of why someone was wrongfully convicted every state should be providing considerable support. Of course you can sue the state afterwards but thats more time and a lot of hassle to ask someone who just gave up a big chunk of their life for nothing and needs money immediately. Even then nothing is guaranteed. Every state needs to automatically compensate these people with a very large amount of money for every year spent in prison immediately when they are proved innocent and freed. I know some states provide up to per year of imprisonment but even that seems way too little when you could have had an established career and depending on the person likely be earning with other benefits and opportunities just by being free.States should be providing considerably more money than that earned through a job while free for a couple of reasons Being in prison can be considered a job thats hoursweek vs the standard hoursweek When youre free youre spending even more time getting adjusted and back on your feet. When you do get a job the pay is usually not much due to the lack of skillsestablished career If I spent decades in prison I wouldnt want to be a slave again working to support myself. Rather I would want money to travel be free and enjoy life to make up for all the years that was robbed from meCommon arguments and my response parts copied from my other post This has only become an issue recently with the rise of DNA testing and the justice system is slow to changeIgnoring DNA testing for a second people been found innocent once people uncover evidence that the prosecution had purposefully hidden during court trials? I dont know too much about this as far as rates and statistics go but I could imagine that this has happened ever since our modern justice system was formed.Even if its slow to change that no excuse to destroying lives and leaving them with nothing since it is incredibly unfair. States just dont have the money to give to all the wrongly convicted.If I spent a lot of time in jail when I repeatedly claimed I was innocent or everyone agrees that I was forced into a wrongful confession that isnt fair to me especially when the justice system is built around fairness. The money issue is the states problem. Remember its much much harder to prove innocence when you dont have a strong alibi. Also if this is the case why is there a double standard? If the state doesnt take responsibility for its wrong doings because it cant afford it why cant I then use the same argument when I do something wrong? For example if Im poor and I was given a fine due to something like a traffic violation why cant I just say oops I cant afford it sorry guys without any repercussions. Lets face it a lot of crimes like traffic violations often happen by mistake. Not always does someone plan to speed or run a stop sign intentionally.

This isnt about those soldiers. This is about soldiers that kill people.Now as far as I understand and if I get something completely wrong please point me to resources I can read to correct my misconceptions most of the time soldiers arent really sure why they are killing people. So what happens is an order is given soldiers get sent out and they must make a choice ashoot people or bbe court marshaled or c do their best to make it look like they are contributing whilst racking up as few casualties while staying safe as possible. Choice a means the soldier values their noncourtmarshaled life as being more important than the entirety of the life of the person they are shooting at to kill. If the person they are shooting at has killed one or more other people its a less cut and dry question but as far as I understand the soldier is unaware of the killcount of the person they shoot at. It is therefore difficult if not impossible for the soldier to act in a moral fashion consistently. Soldiers may or may not act morally even if given the choice but thats a different issue here it seems they are not even given the choice.Outside of refusing to go to dangerous areas and being court marshaled for it c seems like the most moral choice to make but I feel like soldiers shouldnt have to do thatthey should be debriefed on the latest intelligence on how many people everyone or as many people as possible they encounter have killed before going on a mission and be given strict orders to use nonlethal methods when dealing with everyone else. If this becomes impossible to do while staying safe the mission should be aborted and replanned. Commanders who mislead their troops should face some kind of punishment.So the TLDR is that soldiers are people and people killing people who havent killed others or have been a direct cause of the death of others or are unaware of whether the person they shoot at has killed other or not is immoral and should not be done. .'},\n {'id': 't3_27gnxb',\n  'titles': 'Providing a bible in a hotel room is arbitrary',\n  'argument': 'I think its very kind of the hotel to provide some reading material but the choice of a bible is pretty arbitrary.

I love you guys.As always theres a couple threads about gender issues floating around and I saw a particular comment in which someone felt that it was rape if a woman was blackout drunk and a man has sex with her. The definition of blackout drunk in context and the definition Im familiar with implied that she would wake up the following day with little or no memory of having sex not that she was unconscious. Hell I once saw a girl who was blackout drunk sit down at the top of some stairs at a party and start masturbating until someone came to give her the attention she was looking for. Was that dude a rapist because theyd never met before and she was drunk? She definitely regretted it the next day. My opinion I dont think its rape and I dont feel that way as someone thats never been in this situation because if it is I have by this definition been raped. Ill share a brief storyThere was this girl in college. She had a less than desirable personality and Im going to be blunt here was extremely unattractive and unhygienic. On no day that I am sober or even slightly intoxicated would I willingly consent to having sex with her. While I was nicer to her when she offered I had declined several times. We did have a few friends in common though and one night she hits me up and tells me that her and our friends are going out to a club. She offers to pick me up I accept. We get to the club and go figure none of our friends are there. I go ahead and start drinking as Ive been reassured that theyre on their way just running late. Long story short our friends never show up and I knowing that I dont have to drive home and she isnt drinking all that much decide to go ahead and drink my fill. I dont remember much about getting home and the deeds that happened there but I do know this much she knew that I was drunk as hell she knew that I would not otherwise willingly consent to sleeping with her and we fucked.Again Id like to state that no matter how much regret I may have had the following morning I dont feel like I was raped. Was it a bit shady? Maybe but I feel like Im the one to blame for what happened because I irresponsibly got myself to a point where I made a bad decision or best case scenario let someone make a bad decision for me. Would I have done the same as she did? I know you have to be wondering and the answer is that even in this same situation with reversed roles I have never nor would ever. Ill almost never sleep with someone especially not the first time if there has been heavy drinking. For clarification the only reason I say almost because one of my exes was a drinker and we were always pretty wasted when we slept with each other.I should probably point out that I am as indicated by the title talking about the voluntary consumption of drugs and alcohol. In the above example no one was forcefeeding me drinks no one roofied me I voluntarily consumed way too much alcohol.If you get extremely drunk or high on drugs and you murder someone then you are held accountable in spite of how impaired your judgement may have been. If you are extremely high or drunk and you crash your car you are held accountable for your actions. In any other legal situation being high or drunk does not grant you any kind of immunity from your actions. If you get extremely drunk or high and sleep with someone you are accountable for your actions.On top of that I just dont see the consistency. If a girl gets wasted and sleeps with a dude she would not have slept with otherwise is it rape if hes sober but okay if he is also wasted and therefore has impaired judgement as well? Some people will say Im victim blaming and what Im saying is under these circumstances the only thing someone who gets too wasted is a victim to is their own lack of responsibility. .'},\n {'id': 't3_27divm',\n  'titles': 'A banana is not a good method of portraying scale.',\n  'argument': 'Well my view is relatively simple.

It can also mean that it is hard to show the banana very close to the object you are scaling against. Bananas are relatively small this makes them bad for judging the scale of larger objects. This is especially bad when considered in conjunction with point as any difference between the percieved size of a banana and the actual size will be enhanced for an object many times the size of the banana.

Bananas are relatively large. This may conflict with point but the point is that when scaling small objects pins hair ect then a banana is too large meaning that in order to use one for scale you would either need to show only a small amount of the banana therefore making it fairly useless for judging scale or you would need to zoom out in order to show the entire banana thus making the object less visible and therefore harder to judge scale.'},\n {'id': 't3_27cn8y',\n  'titles': 'Concerning promotions pandering to bosses is more effective than being a hard efficient worker who cares about the job.',\n  'argument': 'I work for a mediumsized service company and see people who suck up to our bosses receiving raises and promotions and being groomed for higher positions.

I have a smartphone its not a high end one but it lets me browse the internet when Im out and about and I have a few apps for it.I was lucky enough to get to try the Google Glass at a friends who was part of the group who got them early. But frankly I dont see the appeal of glass over say a regular smartphone like the one I have now. From what I can tell the smartphone I have is superior to Glass in every way.PRICEFor one Google Glass is . Compare that to just for the GB Iphone s. I understand that its brand new and the price will eventually come down but for now thats way too much.SPECS Megapixel camera for Glass compared to Megapixel for the Iphone. p video camera on Glass compared to p for the Iphone. GB data storage capacity for Glass compared to or GB for the Iphone. This doesnt take cloud storage into consideration though.CONVENIENCEOne of the big things that I hear touted about Glass is convenience over a traditional smartphone thereby justifying the price. But lets break that down a bit. I cant play games on Glass very easily such as Tetris or Angry Birds that I can easily play on my phone with the touch screen. These are games that sort of require a touch screen in order to play effectively. The voice feature is nice and is very responsive but what if I want to send a text to someone and dont want everyone around me to know what Im saying? What if I want to visit a website but not have everyone around me know? I could use the touchpad on the side but its not as quick as the keypad on my phone. Even if I got used to it its still probably still not as quick. Glass isnt a phone in and of itself functioning more like a handsfree device. So this means that Ill have to carry around my regular phone in addition to Glass. So that means yet another device in addition to my phone that I have to charge every night and find a place to keep. But I cant keep it in my pocket like my phone since its glasses and they might get crushed. I dont have a purse. And Im certainly not wearing it clipped to my collar like a tourist because it might fall off my shirt and get smashed. Im not wearing it on top of my head because that will look really stupid and again might fall off. So I either have to wear it all the time or get some loose big pockets to put it in.So there goes the whole convenience argument right out the window. Id rather just take two seconds to pull my phone out of my pocket whenever I need to use it than have the convenience of having it all right in front of my eyeballs all the time but at the cost of not having anything to do with the freaking thing when Im not using it. Also Ill still have to use my regular phone for many things and still have to pull it out of my pocket when I need it anyway. What else has Glass promised? Browsing through Googles app store the list of apps available doesnt seem too impressive compared with apps already available on a standard phone. Augmented reality? So like Im walking down the street and see Yelp reviews for all the restaurants appear in front of my eyes? Or see driving directions pop up right in front of me?That would be great if I ever actually went anywhere but Ive lived in the same town for years and pretty much know all the good restaurants and know my way around already. I go on a road trip maybe once a year and I just use the GPS in my car. Works great.What else? Night vision goggles?

I mean by the way society views it the way that people look down and consistently discourage things like narcotics methamphetamines etc.Im now and since the drinking age in my country is Ive seen many of my friends over the last couple of years grow into the alcohol culture that basically the entire world shares. Sometimes this has scared me. Friends that have been with me since I was years old have given me times where I am legitimately scared for my safety because of alcohol all the while the rest of the group and cheering this person on. I dislike the mere fact that getting drunk for enjoyment is socially accepted and even encouraged.I dont drink as youve probably guessed. In fact I stay as far away from the stuff as I can because I detest the taste just like I stay as far away from peas as I can...but also because the mere idea of getting drunk scares me. Loosing rational control of myself is not something I would like to experience especially if it means I could hurt someone.The fact that I dont drink has been a point of contention for my friends family and even just strangers I meet. Everyone seems surprised that I dont and in almost all cases try to get to me to drink in one case even trying to spike a drink of mine with alcohol just to see me drunk. How is this acceptable behaviour in any circumstance? And yet it is when it comes to alcohol because its seen as fixing me or making me less of a drag from not drinking. Ive had to opt out of family events because of this.While it may be a specific case in my family the idea that its acceptable to do that is the culture around alcohol I just dont understand and almost hate. The fact that society views alcohol as a requirement for a good time is something I think is incredibly toxic to our lives. Id say a good hefty percentage of things like car accidents crimes like domestic abuse fighting etc. stems from alcohol. While Im all for the everything in moderation I think alcohol is something that most people cant keep moderated. We glorify alcohol we glorify getting drunk society works hard to associate it with a good time to the point where most people believe that you cant have a good fun time with your friends without getting smashed. People look forward to forgetting their weekend! How crazy is that?!No other drug is glorified this way not even Marijuana admittedly getting closer to it these days which is the probably least harmful criminalized drug. I dont see why society views just alcohol this way and continues to be adamant for the criminalization on other drugs even ones with a similar or less risk level like Marijuana.Other things have come into our society that operate the same as alcohol culturally like smoking. At one point it was all the rage. You were outcast if you didnt smoke just like now if you dont drink. And then people realised that it was harming us harming people with second hand smoke. And its been slowly phased back out. It still exists but at least in my country its something you never talk about its something thats looked down upon by most people. People are surprised and sometimes revolted if you mention you smoke and in common society its not something you do to hang out like drinking. And yet I consider alcohol more harmful because with the amount of alcohol fuelled crimes and accidents I believe its probably done a lot more damage to individuals and indirect people than smoking ever has. TLDR I think that society should be working to discourage alcohol just like we do with other drugs. Its harmful to the people who drink it to the people around it and the glorification it gets in society only serves to promote something I consider inherently bad to people even ones who wouldnt normally drink. Weve already done this with something like smoking which has similar self and indirectly other harming properties that was widely glorified. Please . I want to understand why people think alcohol is considered acceptable to be in our culture in this way. But please dont try to convince me to drink just to try it so Ill see. I dont think my original argument is necessarily wrong itself and I think theyre good points against drinking in general and for the greater education on responsible drinking but my post is clearly heavily stepped in selection bias.Many people have raised the point that alcohol has many benefits too health wise but particularly as a social lubricant that encourages much of the social interaction that we humans so desperately crave. In the long run having alcohol as the one common thing between a lot of people is a great benefit to society we always have a basis to return to.'},\n {'id': 't3_2737r7',\n  'titles': 'I think Muslims do themselves a disservice by using the word Allah instead of God even when speaking in English.',\n  'argument': 'Jews Christians and Muslims all worship the same God albeit quite differently.

However with volts they are always clearly defined a specific battery is labeled with a precise amount of volts an northAmerican household is wired on V Europe is V etc. while current is left to be whatever it needs to be after weve plugged in whatever machine acting with some resistance Dealing with volts makes more sense than with amperes. Amperes are to me always behind In a simple household in America the voltage is always V. The amperage continually depends on what kind of device is plugged in according to Ohms law V RI the current seems more of a product of the voltage and resistance rather than the voltage being a product of current and resistance The base definition of an Ampere is lets face it pretty fucked up. For those who dont know in the SI system you want precise units that can be measured according to fundamental properties of the universe for example a meter is defined using the speed of light second is defined using periods of radiation of a cesium atom etc. with the exception of kilogram but thats another topic So what is the current definition of Ampere? According to Wikipedia it is The constant current which if maintained in two straight parallel conductors of infinite length of negligible circular crosssection and placed m apart in vacuum would produce between these conductors a force equal to newtons per metre of length it just seems so stupid to me to have something defined using theoreticalmathematical and physically unreachable concepts. How could you measure Ampere precisely using this definition? By somehow having two infinitely big wires make them perfectly parallel? And somehow making their circular crosssection negligible? Then youre supposed to measure the force they act on each other and be precise on the order of Nm? To me it would make way more sense to use the volt as a base unit and make it easier to clearly define Volt as for exemple the electromotive force in a conductive wire connection a solution of precise concentration of zinc ions with another solution of precise concentration of copper ions linked with a saline bridge you know an electrochemical battery. Allow me to compare VRI to Fma. You wouldnt define the kilogram as being Fa or the force of newton divided by meter per second squared and then use the Newton as a base unit. It makes no sense the meterkilogramsecond units are more natural than the newton unit just like the volt is more natural than the ampere. You use kilogram meters and seconds as base units and use them to derive the newton along with a bunch of other derived units So why should we use amperes to derive volts given all Ive said mostly in point and ? No you should use the volt unit to derive the ampere unit not the other way around. To expand on this Ill use Faradays law of induction which makes generating electricity from mechanical motion possible. It basically states that the inducted electromotive force is equal to the derivative of the magnetic flux with respect to time. See how it defines electromotive force aka source voltage and not current? Its because current comes from voltage and not the other way around. Volt is a more natural unit than ampere when it comes to electricity and magnetism. TLDR The volt should be the base unit not ampere. Amperes should be defined using volts not the other way around like it currently is.Im making this thread to see if Im missing anything because I feel like Im going against most of the scientific community and its making me feel a bit like a jerk. Id like to see the other side and especially why scientists would chose amperes over volts and give them such an awful base definition as well.

The Taliban has offered to free him for of their own ever since he was captured years ago.

I think that the constant barrage of advertisements is ridiculous since a company could never annoy me into buying their products. I believe that only children and unintelligent people could ever be swayed by these ads.An important point is that I find this last sentence I wrote to be mean and probably incorrect which is why Im here.My decisions on what to buy and where to shop are based on local convenience word of mouth and experience. I may buy a Coke for example but it is not because I have seen a lot of Coke ads. I have never watched or listened to an advert then gone and bought something as a result. In fact the advertisements often reinforce themselves negatively on me meaning that I am so annoyed by the constant yammering from a particular company that I choose not to buy from them on principle. There is one caveat which is that seeing an ad once might be valuable so that I can be aware of a companys existence. Oftentimes this happens through word of mouth or seeing an actual storefront but sometimes a commercial does the trick. A commercial on the radio for a specific fastapproaching event for example would also fall into this category. In other words I have already heard of Coke and Pepsi and no amount of advertisements from these two companies is going to make me want to buy their products more than I would if I had only seen their ads once in fact I may buy them less.Many advertisements we see are for insurance beer and soft drinks and medication. Ive chosen an example from each that I have noticed.. I have seen so so so many commercials for different car insurance companies. However nothing any of these companies say about their rates being lower or their service being better has ever convinced me to switch or even consider changing my insurance. When it was time to get car insurance I searched for all the car insurance companies I could find on Google then compared quotes. I considered every company evenly regardless of how many adverts of theirs I had seen.. I will never ever drink Budweiser Coors or Miller simply because I find their constant TV war over which of the three is the best so ridiculous that I have permanently crossed them off my list. I think it is ridiculous that we are all made to sit and watch these companies fight it out. I believe again probably rudely that anybody who sees a Bud Light commercial and then wants to go drink Bud Light is sort of dumb.. Many prescription medication commercials start off with an attempt to relate to the viewers suffering. I find this disingenuous especially with regards to the elderly. Further I am not a medical doctor and I would never try to tell my doctor what medicine he should be prescribing me.

At the same time amount of evidence for opposite is too large too be ignored. Every guy in my class admitted that has at least once watched a porn movie. Some guys openly said that they want to have sex with someone even if someone is much older than they are. Girls are generally less open about this stuff but I dont think there is that much of difference.Im not saying that every boygirl want to have sex with every other boygirl but that there are people bellow age of consent who would greatly enjoy having sex even with someone much older than they are. Projecting your experience to everybody is a logical mistake. If you couldnt consent before you were X years thats fine but every person is different. Sadly when people discus age of consent they usually forget about that.Also it is ageist to believe that age equals maturity. Not every adult using their age advantage to force teenagers to have sex with them. And being over year old doesnt mean you are safe from manipulative or abusive sex partners. How to deal with those people should be explained in sex ed. classes. Different people have different sexual preferences. I for example absolutely not attracted by boys of my age but love strong and mature grownup guys. Another big fetish I have is crossdressing.

By irrational I mean not founded in the actual state of the real world but instead based on a gut feeling or faith or whateverMen are far more likely to be the victim of violent crime than women are. Men make up the vast majority of assault battery and murder victims. There are nearly ten times as many assaults as rapes. If you include forced to penetrate someone against your will as a form of rape and dont include prison rape the odds of a man being raped in a given year are nearly identical to the odds of a woman being raped in that year. Furthermore rape the only violent crime where a case can be made for women being more at risk than men is nearly always committed by someone known to the victim indoors in a place known to the victim and assailant such as a bar one of their houses a mutual friends house etc. Assault conversely takes place mostly outside committed by strangers.And yet women are consistently more afraid of walking around outside at night alone but also in general than men are. This makes no sense to me change my view.There is also a second related issue that I am confused by. I see articles written by and linked on Facebook etc by selfprofessed feminists which strongly encourage this seemingly irrational fear. For example This also makes no sense to me. Women are less at risk of this than men and being afraid all the time sucks and since theyre less at risk than men this fear serves no useful purpose to them so all that writing this sort of article does is make womens lives worse. Yet when I say that I get yelled at and dog piled by the feminists who link these articles who call me a misogynist sexist an uncaring and unfeeling ass and on and on.That makes negative sense to me and has caused me to selfidentify as an antifeminist because the overwhelming majority of feminist thought I encounter is of the form women should hold this harmful irrational belief or men are evil or no man has ever suffered. A slight exaggeration but only slight sometimes they make very legitimate points about economics. This seeming total lack of ability or willingness? to think about these issues rationally combined with people calling me antifeminist when I point out that this is irrational has convinced me that I am and should be! against the actual existingintherealworld thing called feminism as opposed to the women should have the same rights as men including the right to walk around without fear definition of feminism which I am enthusiastically in favor of and which seems diametrically opposed to feminisminpractice.Change my view please.

These kinds of statements are also often directed mainly towards girlswomen. Proponents of this will say that when a young girl sees a supermodel actress etc. then she thinks she has to look like that while a boy will see it and expects that all girls should look that way.I find this logic to be on a slippery slope and unrealistic. I dont think the media presents a bad example at all they just present the pinnacle of beauty if you will. For example when I am walking by a Victorias Secret store and see a huge picure of Candice Swanepoel I dont imagine or expect all women to look like that. Instead I take on a more realistic approach and form the opinion that she is one of the most attractive people on the planet. On the flip side I dont go watch Oceans and feel bad at the end because I dont look like George Clooney or Brad Pitt.Think of how ridiculous this kind of logic is when you extend it to other things. Would I expect every painter to be on par with Michelangelo every singer to have a voice like Adele every pianist to be play like Mozart? Of course not. Just because you arent as great as they are shouldnt affect your self esteem since they are literally at the pinnacle of their respective field and in some cases in contention for greatest of all time.To sum up I think it is ridiculous to think that the medias constant portrayal of beauty in magazines movies TV etc. is in any way affecting how people view their bodies.Just for clarification I am a guy so that may be influencing my opinion.

Id also like to clarify that even though certain styles are annoying as well this view does not apply to sunglasses because they hold value in their functionality regardless of the person.My main beef with fashion glasses is that they take the form of a functional piece of equipment and remove the utility but dont add anything new. Certainly people can say that the same must be true for accessories like fashion scarves or for things like leather cuffs However even though both of these other examples have roots in utility and function when the functionality is removed something more ornate is added or possible. In the scarf example a utilitarian scarf is thick to provide warmth and insulation a fashion scarf removes the functional thickness but opens the door for patterned textiles or forms that are not possible on thicker scarves. Conversely glasses forms have been derived from their function a necessary form to place prescription lenses in front of the eyes. Fashion glasses gain no advantage by removing the function.The second more obtuse reason for the annoyance is that there is an odd appropriation of an impaired image. Wearing fashion glasses is akin to carrying a cane around even though you can walk unhindered with your two legs or if such a thing were fashionable wearing a colostomy bag even though you have a fully functioning lower digestive tract. Glasses only exist because there was a need to provide improved function to an impaired organ. If for some reason there was never a need for improving vision the form of a fashiononly face accessory would probably look much different than glasses.This largely boils down to me being unable to find an answer to the question Why?'},\n {'id': 't3_26uqns',\n  'titles': 'I believe that Israel are the definitive good guys in the Middle East.',\n  'argument': 'This has everything to do with how Ive been raised.

All I really see from feminism these days is hate hate hate hate and more hate.Ive seen the SCUM Manifesto. I know several of you will try and claim that that was the work of a single crazy and that she didnt represent all of you which I will try to accept. Assuming that some of you do agree with said manifesto though isnt it suicidal for me to support the cause of a group of women who apparently want me as a male to cease to exist entirely? I ask this because I know that it is considered politically correct for men to support feminism these days even though again at this point Im having a hard time understanding how it is in our own best interests to do so.Again yes the PUATRPMRM crowd are fascist assholes. They dehumanise women and the pathetic excuses for women who their tactics actually work with or who support male dominance are traitors to your cause. I understand that. As a man myself I dont want male dominance although truthfully I dont want female dominance either.

Let me also say that more than anything else I believe strongly in the equality of not only the sexes but races sexualities everything. I believe that everyone should be equal and I think this should really be common sense. And yet I cannot bring myself to call myself a feminist. I think my reasoning for this is sound and yet I constantly see people talk about how horrible anyone who claims to believe in equality yet doesnt use the term feminist is. This makes me feel horrible because there is nothing I want more in the world than for everyone to be treated equally. At first I fought against it trying to argue my position and I thought that I was doing well but I just got called names and mocked for it. Now a lot of people that I respect very much have been recently saying this same thing Feminism IS equality the terms humanist and egalitarian are misogynist and Ive come to think that there simply must be something here Im not seeing. Im either overlooking something or being unnecessarily stubborn in a way I cant seem to realize.Before that though here is why I still believe I am at least partially in the right The word feminist implies focus on women just in its name. I dont mind this when used in connection to womens rights thats what its for right? And I certainly support womens rights I just dont like the term because it seems to erase the fact that inequality is constant from both sides. When someone says feminism IS the belief in equality for both genders they are right in the technical sense but by its very nature feminism only focuses on womens issues. Masculinism is stupid for the same reason with the added bonus of devaluing womens issues. I think we need an allencompassing term and feminism does not seem to be it. I have also been faced with discrimination from socalled feminists simply for being a man. I understand perfectly that these people are NOT examples of the movement as a whole but they are prevalent enough that I dont want to use the same word to describe myself as the word they use to excuse their hatred for men which is the definition of misandry though they claim that doesnt exist. I have also been discriminated against for not only being a man but daring to believe in equality. If men truly have more power isnt it more to the advantage of feminists to get men on their side? Not according to the extremists. But those are extremists I am digressing. I understand that the term humanist was claimed by another movement which did not allow women to join. I dont use that term. I dont use egalitarian either if only because of the negative stigma feminists give it but that word means belief in equality for all people and I cannot fathom what the problem with that is. That is exactly what I believe. It goes beyond sex or gender it is all people and that is how I prefer to think of it. Yet if I were to call myself an egalitarian I would be met with cries of such things as youre ignoring womens issues etc. I dont understand how an allencompassing term would ignore any part of it. If anything a term which focuses on women is ignoring part of it. Women CLEARLY have it MUCH MUCH WORSE than men. That is the main reason I think Mens Rights in general is a load of rubbish. I think we should solve all issues of equality but there are priorities that need to be followed and I think womens rights are the priority right now. However there are some issues on the opposite side which I think are just as pressing. For example male victims of domestic abuse have hardly anywhere to get support. Either they are not believed or they are mocked. It is similar for some male rape victims though I have heard from a few actual victims that in recent years this has been getting much better. As a side note one that Ive seen getting thrown around is the higher suicide rate among men... But Im not sure how thats really relevant because I dont see a way to change that without simply better mental health care for everyone and even then the divide would still be there. The phrase not all men has been misused by assholes to distract from real issues but I dont understand why people dont seem to realize that its true. If you dont believe than not all men are like this then you do believe that all men are like this this being misogynistic serial rapistmurderers waiting to happen if they havent already. That is sexism. I perfectly understand the ridiculing of the terms most common use but it seems to get washed away completely because of aforementioned assholes. Isnt that the same thing as discounting feminism because of the manhating extremists?I think I had more to say but Ive run out of steam it seems.

I had never met the guyWell call him Tyler but he was hilarious and would always talk an unbelievable amount of shit to the other team. Then one day it happened. We had just lost a game and Tyler called the other team niggers. I was pretty uncomfortable but my roommate thought it was hilarious. The next thing you know after every game the last thing they would type is GGNNs. When someone from the other team would ask what it meant they would say Good Game Nigger Noobs!! and start busting up laughing.For about a year this continued and over the course of time I started laughing. I began to think it was hilarious. I started joining in calling people niggers and laughing my ass off. We even changed our names in the game to end in Reggin. We were the Reggin Brothers and we called people niggers every game. However we would only call a certain type of player a nigger. When someone on our team would mess up terribly or say something childish that didnt make any sense we called them a nigger.And thats when it hit me we had just reattributed the word to mean something entirely different than its original meaning similar to what happened to the word fag. My roommate and I had many discussions about this and we decided it would be in the best interest of the general population to use it as much as possible so as to desensitize people to it and to lessen violence from misinterpretation over a spoken word. To us the word now meant eithera A highly unskilled person orb A shitty person with no intention of improving be it their lives or their skills That pothead loser that crashes on your couch for months and eats all your food without any gratitude? A nigger. The guy at your work that does as little work as possible while riding the coattails of your coworkers? A nigger. The dude on your sports team that sucks ass and doesnt even go to practice? The biggest nigger.The fact that I can freely talk with my friends about The Nigger Life as we so called it awakened me to the idea that maybe someday people will not get so offended by the use of a word. My friend group consists of a variety of races and we believe that all races are equal and people should not be judged at all based on skin color. However I do judge people based on opinions and if you are one to get offended over a word then I might just call you a nigger.I have a dream that one day a man shall not be called a Nigger based on the color of his skin but on the content of his characterThanks for reading and you are welcome to try and change my view.'},\n {'id': 't3_26nryd',\n  'titles': 'All theistic religion is cancer.',\n  'argument': 'I see all theistic religion as cancerous.

What about poetry is so respected?'},\n {'id': 't3_26nayb',\n  'titles': 'Im not a misogynist',\n  'argument': 'Serious attempt to understand the logic and come to a final conclusion here. Backstory theres women that have been in my life over the past few years that have accused me of being a misogynist for a variety of reasons. I had a discussion today that resulted in me again being called a misogynist. As of right now I tend to assume its just an insult thats being cast at me because Ive won an argument thus being used as an easyout. However what if its true? If so I should probably work on some selfimprovement right?Heres why I think I might be a misogynist Lets just start by saying I absolutely despise the mother of my child as it seems to be a frequent reason Im interpreted as a woman hater. It would be false to say that I havent let my experiences with her have an affect on me but it would also be false to say that because I hate her I must hate all women. Second perhaps what I would see as my closesttomisogynistic trait. Its more difficult for women to gain my trust. This generally only applies to women who Im considering a relationship with. Probably leads into my next point. However I dont have a problem being friends with women or associating with them because how much do you really need to be able to trust a friend or associate? On that level I think distrust everyone fairly equally. For that matter I dont really try to get into relationships with men so... maybe I would distrust men in the same way? Not sure. In all likelihood because of the above point I dont usually give two flying fucks about having sex or especially getting into a committed relationship that extends beyond dating. On occasions outside of the above I do from time to time partake in no strings or friends with benefits arrangements. I make my intentions clear from as early as possible but when asked about escalating to a legitimate relationship I tend to back out of the arrangement and put an end to it. I see this as my best effort to not lead someone on or tie them down because clearly we dont share the same endgame. If I wanted a relationship thats what I would have aimed for from the beginning. I have standards. The few times I have been in relationships my significant other has been attractive and since the breakup with my sons mother had some level of intelligence. I wont consider a relationship even a nostrings one with someone who is overweight or I perceive to be for lack of a nicer way of saying it an idiot. My immediate reaction to someone announcing they are a feminist is a negative one. Im not a fan of the MRM either but thats mostly because of all of the whining and lack of motivation to actually accomplish anything. At least they acknowledge some of the same issues that affect my life. I feel like feminists as a group are actively fighting against what I am. Not saying I cant eventually respect a feminist or that I would suddenly dislike someone upon finding out that they are a feminist but if part of my first impression of someone is that they are a feminist its a red mark so to speak. I realize theyre not all bad I really do but my experiences with people who are willing to speak up and say they are a feminist outside of Reddit have always been bad ones. I have put my hands on a woman once. A knife was involved. Ive had two relationships where I was punched kicked bit and verbally abused. One of them was you guessed it my sons mother. On no other occasion have I hurt a woman. sex accidents excludedThat being said heres the main reasons I think I am NOT a misogynist I dont cheat out of respect for my partner I would think this kind of mentality is the opposite of a misogynist. However Im told that the fact that I have zero tolerance or forgiveness for a cheating partner means I see them as an object that I own. Wtf? Im not controlling one of many traits that probably led to the demise of the relationship between my sons mother and I. In spite of that when Im in a relationship I dont make it a point to lock down my significant other. Again Id think the fact that I dont see women as objects to be controlled is a pretty clear indication that Im not a misogynist. Im respectful as fuck to women especially compared to how I interact with other men. I make it a point to watch my mouth more and Im much more likely to shrug off an offensive comment. Im more than willing to honestly answer any questions if more clarification is needed and if I get no responses Im going to be sure to use an empty thread as a reference the next time one of my female affiliates decides to call me a misogynist. I say Im not .I had never considered the fact that misogyny was anything beyond hating women given the context in which its typically used. I do have some misogynistic tendencies the prime one ironically being something I listed as something that I thought was the complete opposite of misogyny. Fuck me right? Anyways Ive also been made wellaware of the fact that my presentation could use some work. I dont honestly know if Ill ever be able to lift the veil any faster with women than I can with men but Ill work on it.

If you happen to be born in a place or culture a where there is injustice against the group you belong to chances are you will never escape. You will be treated like you are less than human and there is nothing you can do about it. People wont hear your pleas for help precisely because the society you live in has ALLOWED the injustice into which you were born. Likewise if you happen to be born into an abusive or toxic family its very likely that you will suffer psychological and personality disorders that will prevent you from ever being able to form healthy relationships. As a result you will never know what it is like to be loved by a family. Additionally you are more likely to be raped assaulted or otherwise exploited by people who take advantage of the fact that you dont have a decent family to protect you. If you have children the cycle is likely to continue with them. No one escapes.You may hear people around you say that they care about injustice but you also hear them blame people that are in bad circumstances e.g. the homeless the very poor depressed or suicidal people ghetto culture victims of violence or sexual assualt welfare bloodsuckers the mentally ill for those circumstances. You try to convince the people around you that they are being unfair because they dont understand all the factors involved. But you realize after a while that there is absolutely no hope of doing this. People are incorrigible. They dont want to hear or see injustice because they dont want it to be real. I dont know why. I have a few guesses. maybe people walk around feeling slighted most of the time. Like hey I got effed over and I dealt with it so dont ask for any sympathy from me. Maybe many or most people are so immature in this way that they are completely ruled by mine! emotions like three year olds. maybe people are just generally stupid. maybe people are just generally selfish and evil.I have no idea.But I know that people wont listen to you if you tell them you are suffering.

I also believe that this is reprehensible. Your ability to learn and be edified I feel is directly hindered by selfconfidence.In my experience I have learned so much more by questioning what I already thought or did as opposed to being certain of myself. I often find that the most effective means of approaching a situation is to consider as much about it as I can and tentatively operate on what conclusions I do draw but constantly questioning those conclusions until either they work for me or no longer hold water. I think that there is no such thing as overthinking and that any situation can only ever be improved by careful consideration.Consequently I see people that display confidence in themselves and their beliefs as almost intentionally maintaining a blissful ignorance. I do see it as one thing to have a faith and quite another to be a fanatic but I do feel that the divide between those may be a question of confidence. It is also possible to speak with some measure of certainty about your interests and knowledge but it is usually best I feel to be prepared to reexamine your perspectives on even fundamental beliefs at any moment.These perspectives I do not feel have served me very well. I find myself despising confident people as they speak with pride about things they have never once questioned. I see people rewarded for never once considering the ramifications of their actions or words simply because they convey confidence. It seems that many use someones confidence as a measure for how correct or successful they are when if anything to me it conveys only willful ignorance. What am I missing? There are many more ways to be wrong than to be right so surely it is more correct to assume you are wrong at almost all times.In short confidence inhibits learning while selfdoubt gives every opportunity for selfedification. People who display confidence are often ignorant or at least preventing themselves from learning more while those that celebrate and reward confidence are actively enabling this primitive behavior.So...what are the merits of confidence?

Basically the idea is that if a company has more money itll hire more people which reduces unemployment and boosts the economy. My logic thusfar first as far as Im aware there is no evidence that this tactic has ever worked.With that said the companies that would get the most money from a tax cut would be the largest ones like Walmart McDonalds etc. For some reason I doubt that a company like Walmart with a billion net profit needs more money to hire people. Most of the tax revenue the federal government would lose in a tax cut would be going to companies like this that dont actually need it. And we as taxpayers would either have to pay for the difference through our own taxes or take cuts to other services.But lets look at the other companies that would be saving money through tax cuts the ones that supposedly would benefit and hire more people. Lets say the economy is stagnant i.e. neither growing nor shrinking and demand is flat for those companies. They have enough employees and resources to meet demand. Now give them some money to hire more people. What are their choices for that money? Well supposedly they can hire a few people and those few people getting an income will help create demand for products. The problem is those people arent going to turn around and spend their entire paycheck on products produced by just that company so the company is going to get back less than they invested in their workers.Now supposedly tax cuts across multiple companies will create widespread demand but as a company what is the better business decision wait for demand to increase then hire people to meet it or hire people and risk not having demand rise to meet your now excess production or maybe risk having your excess production become obsolete before it can be sold? Obviously the better business decision is the first. Unlike the second it is no risk and guarantees the company saves money and if every company makes that same decision then no one will ever get hired defeating the theory that corporate tax cuts will create jobs.Whats more if demand is outstripping production then assuming the company is actually functioning like any company should it should be turning a profit which would allow it to hire more people anyway. And if demand is so great that they cant hire enough people to meet it then they can just resort to other sources of funding like loans to expand production. This has worked for countless companies in the past and will continue to do so in the future.In the third situation where demand is dropping the company is more likely going to be trimming its workforce not wanting to hire more people.There is a reason why there is no evidence that giving money to corporations works. It doesnt directly create demand and the smart business decision is to wait for demand to increase before investing in increased production. And even then as a profitable business it should have the resources necessary to do so anyway.Im sure Im missing things but what?

These programs have made vast improvements in the conditions of groups identified by the common shorthands of race. Nonetheless those improvements were not worthy of praise since they were no different than any other attempt at categorizing people by the failed nomenclature of races.For example every time a university analyzed its student bodys racial composition it was engaging in incorrect thinking and every time a university implemented admissions policies to foster racial diversity it was chasing nonsense and in the end all the improved racial representation numbers that universities have trumpeted were not something they should have been proud of since there is no such thing as race.Have I overlooked anything in my understanding of this viewpoint?'},\n {'id': 't3_26axzi',\n  'titles': 'caffeinated soft drinks are more harmful than ecigarettes',\n  'argument': 'I feel that caffeinated soft drinks are more harmful than ecigarettes and yet they continue to be sold to and marketed to minors.

There is evidence to show that high fructose corn syrup is also an addictive substance. And the artificial sweeteners that can be used in its stead also come with their host of problems.

Propylene glycol and vegetable glycerine are all approved for public consumption by the FDA and are commonly used as food additives.

The temperatures used in vaporizing the eliquid are only enough to cause a phase change and far too low to cause combustion which is where most of the harmful chemicals are formed when smoking tobacco.The only reason why ecigarettes are banned from sale to minors is due to the continuing stigma from the risks of smoking tobacco.

This could be a stay at home dad foster parent etc. I just used the term mother because that is usually the default term. People always tend to say that being a mother is such a difficult job. Even worse is when people say it is the hardest job in the world. I strictly disagree. Certainly being a parent of any type is difficult as you are responsible for raising a child to be a responsible citizen. Any decision you make ultimately has an impact on how they turn out as an adult. However it seems that as long as you are able to provide certain basic needs they will generally end up as functioning adults. Most children just need basic things such as love and stability. Once you are able to provide those things most of the job is just tedious and time consuming. Eventually everything just falls into a routine. This is especially true for the preadolescent ages before they are capable of taking certain responsibilities into their own hands. As they get older the role of the parent starts to become less mandatory for their development and can even become harmful to the development of the child if there is too much involvement ex. helicopter parents.The actual difficulty just comes from figuring out what kind of strategy you want to utilize to raise your kid. After you figure that out everything falls into order. Running the household while watching the kid turns into menial tasks such as cleaning up after them picking up groceries making sure they go to bed on time controlling how much TV they watch etc. None of these are particularly difficult just time consuming. Thus it is no more difficult than most other jobs that are just as time consuming and menial. To say that this job is more difficult than say a brain surgeon would be unfair. A brain surgeon runs the risk of permanently screwing up a person for life with one wrong move of their scalpel. On top of that in order to perform such surgery you need to train for years before you are anywhere close to being ready to operate. Where as being a mother just kind of happens and you are able to figure it out along the way. In the event of children with extra needs such as those with mentalphysical handicaps this certainly makes the role of being a parent more difficult in the day to day type of life. However in the end everything comes down to routine once you figure out a strategy. In my view I think one of the hardest parenting scenarios is having a child with extreme depression where there is a risk of suicide or selfharm. In this scenario there is not always much a parent can do because of the childs biological predisposition to their condition and it can be even harder because their child could end up dead. While this may be emotionally straining on the parental figure it still can not justify being a parent as the hardest job in the world especially since most parents do not have to deal with this scenario.

Sending the child to school does not absolve them of that responsibility and does not transfer that responsibility to the school.The most common argument I have heard is that children are required to go to school and therefore the school is acting as a parent for those eight hours and is responsible for providing for the students needs during that time. I dont find that argument reasonable for two reasons. The first is that the school is not responsible for providing any other consumable goods to the students pencil paper clothing etc. and it is unreasonable to arbitrarily assign the responsibility of nutrition to them. Secondly if the child was not at school the parent would be responsible for providing lunch. The need for lunch is not caused in any way by the student being in school and I cannot understand why the parent would be absolved of this responsibility due to a change in venue.Please note my argument does not include parents who provide lunch for their children by signing up for the freereduced lunch program as I feel this adequately fulfilled their responsibility.Please help me as I cant help but feel all the people who argue for free lunches for all students are a bit off their rockers. ?'},\n {'id': 't3_26388i',\n  'titles': 'Illegal drugs should stay illegal.',\n  'argument': 'I think illegal drugs should stay illegal and I havent heard a convincing argument otherwise.

This would be far easier and less costly than organizing an entire draft.It would also cut down on the time needed to train the newly conscripted army as the Reservists would have been doing Reserve training all this time and so should at least have a rudimentary knowledge of things.From a strictly nonmilitary perspective it would increase physical fitness amongst young people which in turn should in theory cut down on healthcare costs.It would also ideally increase discipline in the youth of the nation at least in some.Obviously people wouldnt like it.

I dont mean to use this article the basis of my argument and I dont want to spend my time defending it I just wanted to included for those interested. Essentially my current train of thought is as follows. Voter turnout in the United States has turned into a huge issue that politicians and those more politically inclined have latched onto. I believe this probably stems from the civil rights era in which disenfranchised minority voters were denied through unfair voting regulations e.g. voting tests the right to a political vote. The push to get them involved has continued but has become more harmful now that blanket antidiscriminatory laws regarding voting regulations have been put in place. Im sure we are all very familiar with the pushes to get out and vote Especially among the youth vote Rock the Vote!. I am under the impression that this has done nothing more than increased the amount of uneducated voting and turned the electoral process into nothing more than a popularity contest which then in turn is perpetuated by other electoral issues such as allotted campaign funds. I currently believe that voting rights should be more regulated such as voting tests equal across all constitutionally protected groups in order to ensure a stronger and more educated vote. I do believe that this blog summarized this point more clearly than I canThe only argument Ive heard before discussing this issue that has even begun to slightly sway me from this position that voting tests should be more common place is the idea that they would take away the voice from those who do not have the time or resources to educate themselves enough to pass these tests. Mostly the lower class and uneducated. However I would see them included in the voting pool as more harmful as they are essentially just throwing their vote at individuals whom they are not fully knowledgeable about. As far as resources go public information that would be required on such tests would be extremely available given the amount of publicly available resources we have now libraries the internet etc.. Time on the other hand is what I agree with. When you have a hardworking individual who simply cant dedicate the time to learning this information then is that enough to take away their political voice? My thoughts on this though are similar to those who are too lazy to make the effort. Voting should be done by an informed and knowledgeable group of individuals. If one was to just simply vote blindly or misinformed as many Americans do then they are doing more harm to the political system then if they were simply excluded from the voting pool.I can understand that this thought process would dramatically decrease voter turnout but I dont see that as a bad thing. What I am looking for is an argument explaining to me why a smaller voter turnout is so dangerous or why removing the uninformed voter from the electoral process is worse then including them.

We live in an era of abundance where countries as small as Estonia are capable of producing the food supply for the entire planet. There is no constraint when it comes to basic necessities such as food clothing or shelter. This is very different from the preworld war II era when the world still did not have the technical prowess to meet the demands of the world. It is different from the world where Gallbraid hypothesized that population growth will exceed the rate at which we increasing output. He was wrong. Today the rich and poor dont fight for the same goods and services. Even though there is disparity between how much rich and poor earn there is no pressure from the rich hogging resources such as food. If anything the rich spend their income on lavish items such as yatches cars and many other material items which although valuable are not necessary for survival. So what is wrong with inequality other than it makes the havenots jealous of the haves? I understand their are ethical issues with it but what Im more concerned with is how income inequality can be bad for society the economy or our general well being? Response to your replies A lot of you have pointed out that income equality leads to higher child mortality rates health etc. Although some of it is convincing there is not enough evidence to support causation. Others have pointed out that income equality is cause of poverty. This assumption is based on the fact that we have limited resources and when equality rises the rich hog more resources while poor are left with none. Again I must urge that there is lack of evidence in this theory as well. The economic pie has been growing and the rich has been simply getting a bigger slice and there is a legitimate reason for it.

Many of the brewers pride themselves on the IBU International Bitterness Unit numbers for these beers trying to push them further and further into bitter territory.This discouraging in many ways. First it leads to a false perception that craft beer must be bitter. It also means that other styles of beer either imported or from craft breweries are needlessly crowded out of the discussion. I personally am a fan of many of the Belgian styles for example the abbey dubbels and abbey beers in general. Many Belgian beers are willing to use some more interesting ingredients that would get overwhelmed by too hopped. Outside of that I find I also like bocks doppelbocks porters and others.

Something is wrong with us.The rich business savvy Brits they are and the music they make is not only an inauthentic loose impression of folkAmericana music but by bridging the gap between that genre and corporate pop they have perverted the essence of what folk is supposed to be.There exists a tradition of confronting the zeitgeist of society in folk music an independent spirit that will stand up to the bland apathy of a generation of pundits and the status quo.

I believe they are fundamentally incapable of dealing with a dynamic combat event and thus could be relatively easily subdued by strategic fighting and basic wrestling.I believe their threat is largely overplayed in the media and that I personally would be able to best this particular dinosaur in unarmed single combat.

Change my view.'},\n {'id': 't3_25im4s',\n  'titles': 'I think any religion which preaches heaven vs hell while claiming their god to be just and good is logically inconsistent.',\n  'argument': 'Because I dont know much about the theology of religions other than Christianity Ill use this religion as my example and hope it works as a proper representation of other religions like judaism and islam.Some basic tenets of Christianity are as follows God is just good omniscient omnipotent omnipresent loving and eternal. Every human after dying will be judged in front of God. They will either go to Heaven or Hell depending on... ...This is where different branches of Christianity diverge. Some preach that one must claim Jesus Christ as lord and saviour. Some preach that you must simply live a humble life of service to the poor. The actual details dont matter here as youll see. The important factor is that you have to do something to get into heaven and if you dont do it youll go to hell.My argument is as follows If God is just by the normal definition of just then he must punish and reward humans in accordance with their actions. Disobediance must be punished obedience must be rewarded.Heres where it starts to break down Under most human laws the punishment must fit the crime. Murder must be punished my execution. Stealing must be punished by cutting off fingers older laws at least. Generally the level of punishment must match the level of crime. You cant execute someone for stealing and you cant simply fine somebody for raping another person. Even in the Bible law is laid out in a likewise manner. An eye for an eye and a foot for a foot. Why is it that Christianity is allowed to preach such a double standard? When you go to hell its forever. When you go to heaven its forever. What kind of crime could possibly require an infinite punishment? What sort of act of kindness could desereve an infinite reward? You cant kill an infinite number of people. You cant feed an infinite number of homeless. This is simple mathematics and it follows directly from the very law christianity seems to teach.the fundamentalist Christians would probably claim that Im projecting human definitions onto a God whom defies human comprehension. Well I am. Basically God handed down a very cut and dry definition of justice and then claimed that it didnt apply to the afterlife. Why wouldnt it? If I tell a kid hell go into time out if he steals a cookie he understands that the punishment is somehow restoring balance. But then if I say but if you dont tell your friends how great I am youll never eat cookies again. And its gotta be today. Better go find your friends hed think that was completely unfair and hed be right. So why does God get to do it?I know this argument is laced with emotion but I really am trying to appeal to reason. If the human definition of justice applies to God then heaven and hell are both completely unjust and paradoxical. Inversely if it doesnt apply then heaven and hell might be just and fair by gods definition but in a way that is an insult to human reason and Id be obligated to give God the finger if she tried to send me to heaven or hell.In short my view is that humans have no obligation or reason to worship a god who is not by human standards fair and just. While god certainly is not bound by human definitions I think its ludicrous to worship himher if she doesnt obey what humans understand as logic.While the act of defying human logic is not necessarily evil quantum mechanics defies human logic my argument is that humans have no grounds to trust a conscious being which defies logic. One might say but if he defies logic then we have no choice but to trust him. And Id say thats B.S. We can trust quantum mechanics because its been verified experimentally over and over. God cant be experimented on he can only be reasoned about. If he defies reason then he might as well be an insubstantial ghost with no bearing on reality.What really pisses me off is the possibility that I might end up in hell for relying on reason while others end up in heaven for abandoning it.Since I allowed emotion to slip into my argument Ill allow minor appeals to emotion but please try to convince me using solid reason and logic. Perhaps Im merely misinterpretting christian theology but Id say it was pretty cut and dry.I know this was a lot so let me summarize. Christianity and other religions teaches that god is just and well all either end up in either heaven or hell. . Justice by human definition requires that punishments fit crimes. Finite crime finite punishment. There is no such thing as an infinite crime. Ergo infinite punishments are unjust. By symmetry infinite rewards are unjust.. Reason is humanitys most reliable tool. Abandoning it should be punished not rewarded. If god rewards us for abandoning reason or punishes us for relying on it then I hate him and I believe that hate is completely justified under gods own law making it a very paradoxical and contradictory situation.Its come to my attention that I was making a blanket generalization abou christian theology. I wasnt aware that many sects preach a nonpermanent HeavenHell. In that case my argument doesnt apply to those sects only to sects that preach permanent hell and a fair just good loving omnipotent god. The only such sect thats been mentioned thus far is protestant christianity in which I was raised by my parents. Many of my friends also follow this particular teaching. Therefore Im trying to acquire some talking points for my discussions with them about heavenhellgod. My view still hasnt been changed so please continue to try to do so.The main point that hasnt really been contested and yet is truly my central argument is as follows Any religion which preaches a permanent heaven and hell and a fair just good loving omnipotent god is logically inconsistent. This is because finite crimes and finite decisions should not require infinite punishments and infinite consequences.'},\n {'id': 't3_25ha18',\n  'titles': 'Propane is better than Charcoal for grilling.',\n  'argument': 'Propane is better than charcoal for a multitude of reasons.

I am actually interested in having my view changed.First let me give you a little background to explain why I feel the way that I do about the concept of a supernatural being particularly those held as deities by the major world religions. I was raised in a somewhat fundamentalist Christian household and I fully believed the majority of what I was taught until around the age of . Even when I would question some things I could usually find satisfactory answers to my questions through research or by talking to a pastor youth group leader family member or friend. However as I got older and was became friends with people who held world views that starkly contradicted my own I started questioning some of the more basic concepts of my faith not out of rebellion or disdain but simply out of a desire to learn more. In fact at this point I thought that it was simply Gods way of making me a stronger Christian and that once I found the answers I was looking for I would be able to confidently explain them to anyone who asked me the same questions. However as time went on I continued to pray read and talk about the doubts I was having but I ended up coming to the conclusion that there were irreconcilable contradictions within the Bible and within the concept of God or at least the God of Christianity at that point. When I stopped believing in God it was not a decision but simply a realization that I no longer thought that the things I had learned my entire life were completely true. That all happened a few years back. Since then I have had a few backandforth periods between trying to believe again and completely rejecting anything having to do with religion but as I spent more time at college and had more time to think about and explore my beliefs I have started to feel more and more that the idea of God is no more than a fairy tale to help people feel better about a world and a life that can be somewhat bleak at times. I still try to respect my familys beliefs because they really do try to respect mine as well but the more time I spend apart from the church the more I realize how silly it all sounds to me. Additionally I have now had some time to look into other religions as well and despite their differences and my admittedly limited knowledge of them compared to Christianity I find that most of them fall into the same category fantastical stories which are wellintentioned and arguably decent as moral guides but most likely largely fictional. I acknowledge that most of the figureheads of the religions i.e. Jesus Muhammad etc. were real people but I think they were nothing more than philosophical leaders who were deified after their deaths. So now that Ive explained why I dont believe in any god here is what I do believe. I believe that science represents the best of our knowledge and understanding of the world. While we do not know everything and we never will I do not see that as a reason to fill in the gaps with supernatural explanation. As long as we continue to pursue more knowledge and advancement through the rigor of scientific experimentation and theory we will learn as much as we can about the universe we live in and that is good enough for me. I believe that when we die we simply cease to exist and as such I believe it is important to make as much out of this life as possible. I believe that any religion is a largely primitive and illogical construct created simply out of the human desire to believe that there is more to life than meets the eye and that religion as a whole will largely disappear at some point in the future of the human race.You could change my view by convincing me of one of a few things. A I have only completely rejected religion because of my fundamentalist upbringing and a lesser form of Christianity or some other religion might fit into a logical view of the world. B Science and religion specifically one of the major world religions are not mutually exclusive and can instead complement one another for a more complete understanding of life.I should add that simply stating that believing in God would be a good thing will not be enough. Just because something would be nice or convenient does not mean I can force myself to believe it.Addendum In case anyone is wondering the reason I want to have my view changed is simple. Where I live most people are religious and I feel that it would greatly help my relationship with a lot of people if I at least believed in something even if I never return to a full belief in Christianity. Furthermore I am currently dating a girl who is absolutely amazing and with whom I mesh perfectly in just about every other way but she is a Christian although not nearly as fundamentalist as my family and has expressed some concern about my lack of faith. While she has not tried at all to push me towards changing that aspect of myself I would hate for that to be the one thing that stands between us and long term happiness so Im taking the initiative. That may seem like a cheap reason to want to change my entire world view but it is what it is and honestly maybe having something to believe in wouldnt be so bad for me.So there you have it.

I dont want to get into semantics so Im not claiming to be a follower of classical liberalism or neoliberalism or anything else but a modern and hyper liberal American. Since I love this subreddit Ill provide you with some easy arguments for you to knock down. I will change my view if you can show how forward thinking inclusivism secularism or personal liberty are bad values to have or show in some way that being a modern liberal is bad for myself or society. WHAT IS LIBERALISM? Forward Thinking I believe social liberalism correctly pushes the boundaries of what society currently thinks is acceptable towards more egalitarian bounds. Conservative thinking is dominated by ideas like tradition and maintaining order or status quo which it advances at the cost of excluding certain groups. I specifically believe that tradition is harmful as it inappropriately resists change without providing merit. I believe the abolition of slavery suffrage of women lax immigration policies and the guaranteeing of rights by the government are liberal ideas that are beneficial to society. Inclusivism I believe liberalism is an ideology that tries to include as many people as possible. I feel liberalism correctly values the group over the individual. ex What good are my rights if I only get them by infringing on others? I believe that everyone is better off when everyone is given equal protection and rights. When employees have enough disposable income to purchase consumer goods they increase economic output much more than if all the income and wealth was concentrated in the hands of few individuals. see banana republics vs current America and debt fueled consumption as one of the primary cause of the s and depressions. SECULARISM I believe that governments and all nonreligious groups should operate in a completely secular manner because it provides better real world results and doesnt disenfranchise anyone. I believe that corporations should not be able to espouse or enforce particular religious beliefs ex a church can be doctrinally against birth control but it nor any business should not be allowed to deny said birth control to its employees. In matters of science vs faith I will always side with science as I believe most liberals would. I place zero merits in matters of faith when presented as such and believe morality is not provided by grounded in nor should it be regulated by a religion. Any claim not based in fact is either a working hypothesis or a statement of faith. I may have to accept partial blame for radical hippies that do not support data driven science such as gmo haters and nuclear power scardycats. It seems that these people are in the minority among liberals BUT If you feel the average liberal supports these types of faith based antidata claims then please hammer away at me. PERSONAL LIBERTY The government is the primary protector of the citizens rights and liberties. Personal responsibility outlined by libertarians and conservatives only goes so far since vigilante enforcement is not as conducive to society as official police actions and lynch mobs should be replaced by a judiciary. Liberals believe that morality and personal behavior should not be regulated by an outside entity. Free love marrying whomever you chose freedom of and from religion st and th amendment rights and the right to privacy are all liberal ideas that I support. I do not believe you have the right to infringe on the rights of others. I believe that women are the equals of men and that all races are equal to each other. Separate but equal is not equal and true equality not only means equal rights but equal opportunity to fulfill those rights.Lightning round... nd Amendment pro gun ownership pro heavy regulation Big Government globalization and big businesses need big government support. Remember only conservatives say I demand big government get their hands off my medicare. Taxes The required big government needs big income. Our current government is too big and can be for sure be streamlined but it cannot be halved or quartered. Climate Change I side with science. No there is no debate. Abortion I can prove with science that the mother is alive. Until you can prove with science that a specific subset of her cells commonly known as a fetus is a separate and living organism capable of equal amounts of autonomy as the mother then I feel you have no ground to stand on.

For the sake of argument Ill list my problems with it. Belle.I find her to be void of personality whatsoever. Shes very D like the old princesses such as Snow White or Aurora. And shes also somewhat of a Mary Sue. What is the likely hood that the prettiest girl in all of the town is also the most wellread articulate modest selfless and non judgemental? Shes too perfect of a character for me with her only negative counterparts being that she is some of those descriptions to a fault. The love story.Beast is an ACTUAL Beast. Hes not just beastly very hard on the eyes hes an actual monsteranimal looking thing. Hes not human. Like at all. Belle has no way of knowing that he was once a human and cursed into being a beast. Sure she goes into that one wing of the castle and sees a picture of the human him on the wall but if youre telling me that she pieced everything together after that youre lying to yourself as well. She willingly fell in love with an animal. In a romantic way. Not to mention the fact that he kidnapped her and she fell in love with him which I think is commonly referred to as Stockholm Syndrome but idk. Gastons death.Why? Why kill him? Because he tried to kill the beast? In Gastons defence the Beast is almost the same character but with a second chance at redemption. To me killing Gaston was the easy way of just burying that story. Were supposed to hate Gaston and love the Beast but theyre just too similar that I cant have such opposing views on them. At least Gaston was humorous and got a song. Human Beast appearance wiseNo. Timing pacingThere actually seemed to be a very minimal time that went past in this movie. There was hardly any interaction between the two thus making me feel as though the love between them didnt exist at all. The initial conflict. I dont have too big of a problem with this but his consequences for being a dick dont seem to fit. He gets turned into a beast which sounds about right but where my problem lies is where he cant be turned back into a human unless he learns to love another and be loved by another. This on paper seems fine but at the end of the day he falls in love with the prettiest girl in town. How does that prove anything? I know its Disney and the possibility of an ugly female loveinterest doesnt exist but it seems a little counter productive to have the man who judges people off of how they look to fall in love with the prettiest girl. rantIt should be noted again that I dont hate this movie I rather enjoy it.

The second reason is that more people would have a reason to code. For everyone who wants people to lean to code here is a viable reason for people to bother doing it. SQL is code people can use to organize and count their items. It would be code that is actually useful to them and not just some boring hobby the government forces them to do in school.The third reason is that you can link it to other applications. Embedded databases like SQLite can be connected to graphical applications for easier management for some people or command line applications for easier management for other people. The format is open and flexible so it would be more future proof than a common spreadsheet format. Reports can be generated to make more applicable output for another application.I believe the use of spreadsheets should be deprecated and and that everyone should migrate to embedded databases because they are less clunky allow a real reason to code and can link to other applications to produce the reports you want. fixed ambiguous capitalization'},\n {'id': 't3_24xu2q',\n  'titles': 'I dont like prologues and seeing a book has one will instantly prejudice me against it.',\n  'argument': 'Prologues are pretty popular in fantasy novels but Im not a fan of them. There are several types of prologues and for each one I can see reasons that theyre not needed. I feel that often inexperienced writers include them because theyve read other fantasy novels that have them and think youre meant to have a prologue in a fantasy novel but I dont think they work for novels.I refer only to novels in this instance not to other media like movies TV shows and comics. I think prologues work fine in visual media especially films where the first couple of minutes might be accompanied by latecomers finding their seats and conversations begun during the adverts trailing off to make sure the audience are paying attention.But in fantasy novels in particular theyre usually one of the following types. The history of the worlduniversecountry. An info dump of history stars swirling worlds forming battles fought and lost or won magic systems dragons disappearing and all that stuff. These are boring because the author is giving me information about a world I have no reason to care about yet often in a fairly dry tone lacking in conflict and characters. And whats more all the information which is actually important can be fed into the story or hinted at gradually a method I far prefer because I like working things out about the world as I read and building up my understanding over time.. The father of the hero type prologue. Doesnt necessarily include the father of the hero but often does. This is a scene set usually a generation or so earlier than the rest of the novel involving characters who either dont reappear at all or dont reappear until the final third of the book by which time Ive forgotten about them. I dont like this type of prologue because it gets me invested in a set of characters only to break with them at the end of the prologue and try to get me invested with a fresh set of characters and because as with the history of the world type they often contain information that could be woven into the story gradually instead.. The heros normal life prologue. At worst this type is boring tedious and irrelevant. Sometimes it lacks conflict just showing how fantastic everything is for the protagonist before something comes along and ruins things. At best it could be renamed chapter . Either it shouldnt be there or it shouldnt be called a prologue.. The bad things are happening elsewhere type prologue. This is the least bad of the lot I suppose but still better suited to screen than page. This usually includes either a the villain concocting a plan or giving order that will disrupt stuff for the hero we have yet to meet or b some poor sap gets murdered by something. Often prologues of this type are vague or are clearly deliberately keeping some key piece of information back from the reader.In general all prologues share a key flaw the book has to start twice. The prolgoue is usually selfcontained and so reaching the end of the prologue is like reaching the end of a short story without the kind of hook to read on and find out what happened to character X that you find at the end of chapters. Theres little or no investment in characters because either there werent any or those that there were dont reappear until much later in the book if ever.I therefore find prologues pretty offputting. I will acknowledge that there are some that are done well by the more experienced writers like George R R Martin but most of the time seeing the word prologue on the first page puts me in a mindset thats a lot more critical than I would otherwise be. I want my attitude changed because this isnt a good way to start reading a book. In fact Ive not finished a book in months though Ive started a few.Saying the prologue in book X is good isnt going to change my view because I know some prologues are good but I feel on balance that theyre not a good idea for newer authors in particular.Im not sure what will change my view. A new perspective Ive not thought of I suppose.'},\n {'id': 't3_24w84s',\n  'titles': 'The check your privilege phenomenon is not racist against white people rather it calls for an awareness of the cultural and historical reality in which we live.',\n  'argument': 'There was a lot of uproar this week about an article written by a Princeton student on the topic of checking ones privilege. The problem with this expression is that it means different things to everyone. Some people including this Princeton student interpret the phrase as meaning something along the lines of fuck you white boy your opinion is made invalid by the advantages given to you by society. As such that shining bastion of white America Fox News sprang to the defense of this kid to proclaim that prejudice against the opinions of an individual based solely on skin color or gender is wrong in any form. I certainly agree with that assertion but checking ones privilege does not mean that ones opinions are void simply because one is caucasian or a man or Christian. Rather my interpretation of checking my privilege is that it means to have an awareness of the political and historical reality that I was born into and have grown up in. Life experience is the means by which we evolve as people our opinions words actions and thoughts are all defined by our perception of ourselves and our place in the world. That perception is undeniably linked to the historical and political context in which we exist. When you are told to check your privilege you are being told to open your eyes to the reality of your situation to the way that society treats you compared to how it treats others. In other words realize that your experience is unique and that the opinions of others are no more or less valuable than yours regardless of social status. This concept makes white people uncomfortable as we have rigged the societal system so effectively to our own benefit. They would prefer to ignore the advantages they have over others. As a result checking ones privilege becomes an attack on the comfort of white america in the cozy little system of oppression it has created for itself. TLDR Checking your privilege doesnt mean that being white or a guy or straight or whatever discredits your accomplishments and opinions just that individuals should have an understanding of the reality in which they exist and how that reality affects them and others.'},\n {'id': 't3_24w4ny',\n  'titles': 'I think I should learn what I want to learn in high school.',\n  'argument': 'Im homeschooled and currently nearing the end of sophomore year of high school. But Im extremely discouraged because Im essentially failing at everything but math. The main issue is that my parents are not really a part of my education I do it on my own. Im fine with this except that I really detest the chemistry course Im supposed to have been doing this year I havent even been able to pass any of the later tests and my historyliterature syllabus is really vague and I havent learned a thing.Also Ive never been taught how to write a paper. All my attempts have been pretty awful and I can never seem to scrounge up enough stuff to write about. I dont believe Im actually that bad at writing its just that I never write papers about any subject I know anything about.Ive talked to my mom multiple times about these issues and she always just kind of says Hmm well your sister did all right with it. I have a sister whos a grade above me also homeschooling.The fact is I hate chemistry. I greatly respect it and I understand it is a useful subject to learn... if you plan on making a career out of it which I dont. Which brings me to my next point.What I enjoy doing and learning about is D modeling and rendering. I use Blender and Ive learned a bunch and gotten good with it. But this counts for absolutely none of my school credit. I have to learn some science that I have essentially zero use for and wont even fully understand or remember anyway. Algebra I actually get and it happens to be a little relevant to programming and D graphics. Maybe not as much as geometry but Ill be doing that next year and Im not worried about it.But I dont remember a bit of the biology I supposedly learned last year and it looks like my chemistry has gone the same route. I really do want to understand chemistry at least enough to make a passing grade so that I can graduate high school. But Ive tried online courses and none of it has really clicked. The problem is partly that my text book explains things really crappily but its also that I just dont care for chemistry. At all.I hear physics wont be as bad and Im sort of looking forward to it. Technically I dont even have to do both chemistry and physics just one or the other. I wish I could just give up on chemistry go ahead and start physics over the summer so Im not an entire year behind and not be judged and frowned upon for not learning this rather irrelevant science.So the bottom line is I feel confident about what I want to learn about and do with my life but apparently its not OK to learn just the subjects that will be relevant to me and my life. I hear that the education system didnt used to be like this and that high school used to actually prepare you for a career. I absolutely wish this was the way it was.One more thing I am posting to rchangemyview but this could very well have also been posted to some kind of advice subreddit. Id love it if you could change my view but to do that youre going to have to convince me that Ill even be able to graduate because as it is my high school education in the eyes of my family if they even knew how behind I was would be a huge crumbled mess.Well this has basically been a stream of my thoughts and hasnt been edited for nice readability.

I struggled for a while after losing my faith. I went from being certain that I was going to get into heaven someday to being uncertain of the existence of freewill afterlife and objective morality. It was a bit disconcerting but I held onto my intellect and pursued the wisdom of great men and women to try to figure out what was what.I came to the conclusion that while nihilism is certainly a plausible world view I simply couldnt accept it. I also decided that the concepts of heaven and hell were too similar. Theyre both prisons. Id like to live forever but not in a cage.I recently heard a quote from Bo Burnhams What. He had a song with the line You pray so badly for heaven...Knowing any day might be the day that you die...But maybe life on earth could be heaven...Doesnt just the thought of it make it worth a try?It got me thinking about what the human race and sentient life in general is capable of. If the universe is a truly harddetermenistic system then it might be possible for the human race to literally build heaven and bring back from the dead anyone who ever lived. All you need are the data and you can reconstruct anything.It might even be possible for us to overcome that pesky heatdeath time limit. I know these theories sound way outthere but I honestly believe the human race has the capability and the obligation to rely on its own powers. The only other option is to trust God or the Gods which is tantamount to giving up. We werent created or evolved to let somebody else save us. Humans have been overcoming physical obstacles for millenia without any supernatural help. Lets continue doing that. my definition of heaven. One of two desinations in the afterlife in which believers or the good ones are allowed to live in infinite happiness and peace completely in allignment with the will of God the creator for eternity. My definition of God. if one exists The ultimate being creator of everything except itself. Attributes omniscience omnipotence omnipresence essential goodness. This precludes that the creator must be a conscious being not merely a force or energy. Supervenience theory says that large systems are limited in the types of qualities they can have by the qualities of the parts theyre made of. This means that consciousness can only be the result of two things A a minutely conscious universal substrate or B a supernatural realm from which our consciousness is peering in on the physical realm. in case A our consciousness is merely the result of the universe producing sufficiently complex structures and therefore we are all part of one universal mind which will die in the heatdeath if we dont find some way of overcoming that obstacle. in case B there exists some supernatural realm to which we may or may not go when we die. That supernatural realm may or may not simply be another world or some sort of waiting room before we go to heaven or hell.I saidThis was too bold a statement. While God may or may not have contributed to humanities success my belief is that we shouldnt rely on his help forever. While Im certainly ok with people using belief in God as a mental crutch please ignore the negative connotations I think humanities ultimate destiny is to learn how to make its own decisions without the help of its original creator.

In heroic defeats the losing side at least gets to go down with honor dignity and glory whereas a blundering victory usually just serves as another example in highlighting the horror and incompetence of war. This is a hard case to argue I understand as many people understandably are against war in general. However I believe that as humans warfare is an inevitable part of our existence and if its going to occur we may as well accept that the examples of glory and bravery displayed in battles showcases an enlightening side of the human spirit. However I must preface that Im discussing this from a philosophical poetic point of view. I accept that realistically a defeat is almost never a good thing for the army being defeated however I am arguing it is better for both sides than a blundering victory.Look to the first Battle of Thermopylae where the Spartans infamously held off the combined might of the Persian empire for three days before succumbing to treachery and meeting a glorious death. Though the were eventually felled the battle remains one of the most celebrated in history and serves as the locus classicus of the heroic last stand. Compare such an inspiring rousing event to the blundering victory of the Soviet Union in their repelling of Germanys Operation Barbarossa. Germany had all the advantages however with the coming of winter their forces were entirely crippled and so they found themselves slaughtered by Red Army forces. There are over a million casualties recorded in the Battle of Moscow alone many due to the blundering accidental nature of the Soviet victory. In the case of the Spartans humanity has clearly benefited from their displayable of such great bravery Weve gained literature films music and stories from the battle. At the same time the Spartans who died to make such a thing possible have gone down as some of historys greatest warriors. Meanwhile in my example of Barbarossa millions were slaughtered in an accidental largely environmentally caused victory and nobody was remembered. In Thermopylae the Persians gained traditionally victory while the Spartans gained glory and a place in historys metaphorical wall of fame. In Barbarossa due to the coincidental aid of winter working against German forces they were able to scrape a victory though there are scarce tales of glory and heroism told concerning the event. Please understand Im not using these battles as evidence for my argument per se but merely to help you understand where Im coming from in this belief. I know its a controversial belief but the way I see it the inspiration gained and glory displayed by humanity in heroic defeats outweighs the short term benefits gained by one side in a blundering victory.George S. Patton said Battle is the most magnificent competition in which a human being can indulge. It brings out all that is best it removes all that is base. All men are afraid in battle. The coward is the one who lets his fear overcome his sense of duty. Duty is the essence of manhood. and I feel such a quote perfectly highlights my point of view.'},\n {'id': 't3_24pgmg',\n  'titles': 'I believe that downvotes are about as useful as upvotes and should generally not be discouraged for the most part.',\n  'argument': 'I believe that the sorting of comments is improved when people downvote almost as frequently as they upvote. We are all familiar with the phenomenon of late posts getting buried and early posts remaining at the top of the thread. This phenomenon is the direct result of the fact that most people only read the first few comments in a thread combined with the fact that people tend to upvote significantly more than they downvote.Let me use a hypothetical example to explain my point. Imagine there is a hour old thread with comments in it and the top five comments are all mediocre comments that of people who read them upvote. Then someone posts an extremely high quality comment that over of people who read it upvote. This comment starts with upvote so it is at position or so out of the comments. So after a couple hours people view the comments of them view the first five comments and only about of them view the th comment. So the top five mediocre comments would get upvotes from of the people upvotes and the amazing post at position would get upvotes form of the people who read it upvotes. I hope this illustrates how in a world where people only use upvotes and not downvotes top posts will tend to remain at the top even if they are only moderately good comments while great comments that are posted late will tend to remain near the middle or bottom unless they are linked to by rbestof or something.I think we can all agree that it is more desirable to have comments sorted by perceived quality than by some other arbitrary method how early you posted. If instead of only using upvotes people used downvotes just as frequently this problem is greatly improved. In the same example as before lets assume that everyone votes up or down on every post they read. So instead of just not upvoting the posts that they feel dont deserve an upvote they downvote it. In this situation of people would upvote the top five posts and of people would downvote them so even though only of people actually go down the list to read the high quality th post its upvote count will still rise faster than the top five mediocre posts.I believe that in a subreddit such as r you should not downvote opinions just because you disagree with them but I also think that you shouldnt upvote comments just because you agree with them for the same reason. You should upvote comments that you feel are of high quality and downvote comments you feel are of low quality. We want the comments to be sorted from best to worst so that when someone visits a thread they will be confronted with the most compelling arguments first.So that is why I think it is misguided for the mods of r to encourage people to not downvote posts in general. I totally support them asking people to not vote just based on whether they agree or disagree with someone but I think people should vote both up and down based on how compelling they feel the argument is.Im going to preempt a few concerns here Downvoting discourages people from voicing unpopular opinions.First off I dont think you should downvote an opinion for being unpopular but only if you think it is a bad argument i.e. it is a logical fallacy or it makes some assertions that are objectively wrong like if they claimed that we shouldnt invade Iran because its in South America. Secondly I think its more important to sort comments properly than to worry about peoples feelings getting hurt from negative karma. I think if you are avoiding posting things because you are worried about a negative karma score that is pretty ridiculous. Even if most people think a comment is low quality that doesnt mean everyone will think so. By downvoting comments that the majority of people find low quality you are making it less likely that someone who might find it compelling will see it.You could make the same argument against sorting it by upvotes only. Just because the majority of people consider a post to be high quality doesnt mean everyone will and by allowing the highest upvoted comments to rise to the top you are pushing the less popular posts to the bottom making them less likely to be seen by someone who isnt convinced by the popular arguments. I think if you want to make this argument you cant just make it against downvotes but against sorting by perceived quality in general. If people downvote OPs comments heshe wont get as many responses so it will be harder to change their view.I agree with this and you should never downvote OPs comments in their own thread. But if you arent the OP then I think it is better to address the most compelling arguments. It is better to report arguments that break the rules than to downvote them.I am not talking about comments that violate the rules. I am talking about totally legitimate comments that address the topic with real questions and concerns. But if there are a lot of really great comments they should be sorted in a logical way with the best comments first and the worst comments last. Yes you should report any comments that violate the rules. Other than that you should upvote comments you find especially good and downvote comments you find especially bad. Maybe there are two comments making the same point but one does so with referenced sources and the other does so without sources and in a confusing or arrogant way. So upvote the better one and downvote the worse one even though neither of them needs to be reported.'},\n {'id': 't3_24mzo8',\n  'titles': 'Most gay rights supporters are hypocritical and think about sexuality the same way as conservative evangelicals do.',\n  'argument': 'I first started thinking this when Rick Santorum made his infamous comments comparing homosexuality to bestiality.

Its based on human nature. Emphasis mine Imagine that argument being used on gay marriage. Nowadays youd rightly get laughed out of the building. How about the fourth entry on this otherwise correct article which says the idea of marrying whomever you want is childish. Hows that for marriage equality? Another one that compares polygamy to pedophilia year olds cannot consent in the second paragraph using the same cheap shot hes criticizing. This shows the thought process behind all this they think about sexuality and law just the same way conservative evangelicals do. They consider sexuality they approve of to be worthy of being legal and scorn sexuality they find disgusting or wrong. Im not a polygamist nor do I want to be one but I recognize that social change is constant and GRA are not as highandmighty as they think. When the new social issues come up they will be the ones with the bigotry and they will be the ones standing in the doorway blocking up the hall.Bt then again this all is making me agree with Rick Santorum and Mike Huckabee so please !'},\n {'id': 't3_24mrtc',\n  'titles': 'Change the legal definition of birth to when the birth certificate has been filed',\n  'argument': 'Being born has two meanings when a child is expelled from the womb and when a new legal entity is recognized by the state.From Changing the definition of birth and when legal protections apply offers many benefits to parents and the state.If birth is not recognized until the birth certficate has been filed then parents can decide to discard damaged or unwanted babies which would be a legal abortion instead of an illegal murder.Fathers could opt out of child support by not signing the birth certicate. The number of single parent households would drop because the baby would not have been born until both parents sign the birth certificate. Until the baby has been born the birth certificate filed it would not be a citizen.Cases of misattributed paternity could be eliminated by requiring a paternity test before the father could sign the birth certificate. Prenatal genetic testing can identify paternity as an incidental finding. Birth certificates would identify the parents of the child and not the people intending to raise it so anonymous sperm and egg donation would be illegal.Prenatal paternity testing would allow for provisional filing of the legal birth certificate before the baby has been physically born.Babies that have been physically born but not legally born would be in a legal state similar to cohabiting couples who are not married.'},\n {'id': 't3_24mdbl',\n  'titles': 'Using Nazi comparisons can be a valid way of discussing a point',\n  'argument': 'My view is that in some situations a nazi comparison can be a useful and valid tool in an argument and that when such useful comparisons are made Godwins Law and other similar cultural memes serve only to make the discussion less fruitful.

Ive never been one for the console war and I consider fanboyism foolish. Ive owned most consoles from all the major manufacturers since the late s and have been a PC gamer since the late s. In all my time gaming whilst there have been bad consoles sure Virtual Boy anyone none have felt quite as useless and pathetic as the Xbox One to me after all even the Virtual Boy was an experiment into new technology. It didnt work but it was trying at least...You see I genuinely hate the Xbox One. I hate what it represents I hate what it champions in the industry I hate its build quality and this really bothers me. Id hate to think of myself as a mindless hater or fanboy and clearly there must be reasons people own an Xbox One or they wouldnt have bought them but I cannot place these reasons. Ill go through all the points I can consider and explain my reasoning.. TVApps All these apps Netflix Skype etc. are already available on pretty much everything else. My PS can play blurays and Netflix and its foot away I dont need another console or this. Why would I buy a new console for something I can already do on my PC Phone Tablet and multiple consoles I already own. More specifically why would anyone buy an Xbox One for this. If you want Netflix buy one of those cable boxes for like or a lastgen console like the PS. Not only do you get Netflix but you also dont need to pay for Xbox Live Gold on top of an expensive console.. Exclusives Ryse Fighter Within Xbox Fitness... does anyone actually care? Im being serious. They all appear to be either kinect games sports games or both. Only Ryse breaks the trend and thats a poor mans God Of War with excessive quick time events and bloody microtransactions so it couldnt be more worthless in my mind.. Big Franchises Dead Rising is an exclusive... but zombies are so overdone now and Ive still not even played Dead Rising properly. Worse still it looks like theyve taken away the zany fun to make it more gritty like every other game out there. Theres Forza I guess but I can play the last Forza game on my and it has more content. Titanfall not really my thing but if I wanted to play it Id do so on my PC or I can get it on my same with Assassins Creed Call Of Duty or anything else thats come out recently.. Next Gen Experiences Like what? All the so called next gen experiences look like last gen games with maybe a little more polish. Theres nothing that makes me feel wowed all it seems theyre doing is adding an open world to everything. Witcher Open World Metal Gear Solid V Open World Dragon Age Inquisition Open World. Add in all the games which are sandbox games by design which would necessitate being open world such as WatchDogs Batman Arkham Knight GTA V etc. and it quickly becomes all were getting. Does everything have to be open world now? Seriously did anyone think racing games like Need For Speed or The Crew needed to be open world? Sure I like a sandbox game on occasion but I do actually like linear tightly scripted games as well.. Upcoming Exclusives Such as? Seriously theres nothing coming. Theres likely a Halo game and a Gears Of War game in the works and thats it really... and I have them already on Xbox Im not paying for them again. The stories where both concluded stop milking the franchises with unnecessary sequels. Then theres Fable Legends which isnt even slightly interesting after they butchered the franchise previously on and Quantum Break which looks like flashy crap much like Beyond Two Souls and Heavy Rain games with no actual gameplay that play like pisspoor movies. Theres nothing here worth noting.. Multiplatform Games Sure there may be an excess of open world games but Im still excited to play things like Batman Arkham Knight and Witcher then theres games like The Evil Within Final Fantasy XV and Cyberpunk which all look incredible... but why would I ever choose the Xbox One for these games? The PS will play them smoother and at a higher resolution and the PS actually has exclusives Im interested in like The Order InFamous Second Son and Dynasty Warriors Xtreme Legends. Likewise the PC will play these games far better too as well as having PC exclusives that consoles simply cant do properly like the Civilization series Tropico EVE Online and more. The Xbox One just cant compete.. Corporate Attitude While the used games and DRM bullshit is behind us its only software and it could come back at any time. Add in the locking of everything even Netflix behind the paywall of Xbox Live Gold and the addition of microtransactions into practically every bloody game they release and Microsoft have made themselves seem extremely anticonsumer. Sure I know all companies are out to make money Sony and Nintendo are just as money hungry but neither of them seem quite so stupid as Microsoft to sabotage their products in the hope of quick cash. I simply dont trust Microoft to do anything without trying to bleed my wallet dry in the process.In the end I can justify almost any console even ones I dont like such as the N. I really like the Wii U because it offers me interesting exclusives unlike the other consoles such as Super Mario D World and Donkey Kong Tropical Freeze other consoles are ignoring platformers it seems and older games like Deus Ex Human Revolution have some interesting extra features. The PS PS Xbox DS and PS Vita all have exclusive games I want to play on them. Xbox One simply doesnt.In short my view of the Xbox One is that its an overpriced console that does nothing. Every game it can play is better somewhere else every function it offers is done better somewhere else and even its exclusives are mismanaged at best and totally uninteresting and anticonsumer at worst. If Im wrong and theres a reason to own a Xbox One that isnt mindless brand loyalty Id love to hear it. I pride myself on being someone who doesnt fall into the console war mentality and if someone genuinely enjoys something I dont thats fine but currently I look at what the Xbox One has to offer and what it will offer in the future and I honestly consider anyone whos bought it to have made the wrong decision. Its clearly a bad console... Can you change my view? Do you own an Xbox One and can you justify it for me? I hate feeling like the haters you get on YouTube childishly saying your console sucks but I honestly cant see the value in the Xbox One and it baffles me that anyone would choose this over either a PS or a Gaming PC.'},\n {'id': 't3_24io3e',\n  'titles': 'I dont think that banning abortion will actually have any affect on the number of abortions.',\n  'argument': 'I am a ProChoice person.

I strongly believe in life liberty and the pursuit of happiness and if youre not hurting anyone then you get your freak on and be whoever you are. However the labels are getting to be a bit too much. I agree with a sentiment that I see all over the sub a lot of these labels are created by attention seekers who cant stand to be part of an already defined group and must create their own category. No amount of evidence arguing diversity seminars or PowerPoint slide presentations will convince me that theres a difference between bisexual and Pansexual. However I have no dog in this fight. I am a straight male who happy being a male and doing manly things. First it was LGBT. Then it was LGBTQ. Now its LGBTQIA. Again not my concern. They can use as many letters andor labels as they want. However I find the use of the term cisgendered or cissexual to be ridiculous. It is an unnecessary term.According to The Williams Institute approximately of the population classifies themselves as LGBT. That leaves who do not. I do not know the validity of this number and Im sure there is a range of agreed upon statistics. In my opinion cisgendered or cissexual is the default setting. Those with alternate sexual or gender identities are the minority. That in no way suggests or implies that they are bad or wrong. There are simply less of them. I think its rather safe to assume that someone is cis unless they tell me otherwise. If they want me to know that they fall into a different category or even a variety of different categories then I assume that they will tell me. I do subscribe to the rather antiquated notion that what you prefer to do in the bedroom is your own business and doesnt need to be broadcasted but thats just me.Polydactyly exists. It affects a small portion of the population and thus there is a label or designation for it. In no way is this label meant to shame or degrade those with the condition. However one who is born with no extra fingers or toes does not require a label. Why? Because most people have fingers and toes. It doesnt make them better. There are just more of them. Designating someone as nonpolydactyl is ridiculous.There is a small percentage of the population that is designated as special needs. This is a broad term that can apply to many different conditions. Again the label special needs in no way is meant to demean them or belittle them. However it would be unnecessary to introduce you to my regular needs friend Eugene. Somewhere along the line normal became a pseudoslur. If I advertise myself as just a normal guy then I have implied that someone different from me perhaps gay or trans is abnormal. Now that word does carry a certain air of disgust even though its definition simply means unusual or uncommon. I would never refer to a person whose gender identity or sexual preference was different than mine as abnormal but I find it confusing that some folks get angry if its implied that they are part of a smaller group.Minority carries a lesser degree of the same stigma. Minority just means youre part of a smaller group. By definition lefthanded people are a minority roughly . However if you informed left handed people that they were in a minority I find it difficult to believe that any one of them would be offended.Patton Oswalt had a great bit about watching a group of kids playing some elaborate game with all sorts of rules and regulations. So they would say Okay uh the bike path over at the skaffetys is lava and if you touch that youre dead. And then the hedges over at the slingerlands are poison snakes...and if you go over there theyll bite you and youre dead.One of the kids proclaims Patton to be dead because he touched the bike path and the bike path is lava. He then has to explain that hes not playing and the lava rule doesnt really apply to him. Thats exactly how I feel. Im not playing. I dont need someone else to give me a label because I dont fit into a smaller group. Feel free to change my view but be aware that any replies lambasting my cis privilege will be completely ignored.Part of my issue wasis that I never really interact with much diversity. I have a few gay lesbian and bi friends and while its not a secret that characteristic just doesnt come up in conversation. The few people that Ive met that do exhibit some gender diversity or otherwise unique sexual preferences were absolutely unbearable.

My opinions on Ron himself aside voting for a libertarian presidential candidate was a waste of a vote for anyone who chose to do so. I believe that anyone who at least when it got closer to election day honestly thought that Ron Paul would magically shoot up in ratings and somehow nab the election was either grossly misinformed or simply ignoring the facts in front of them. It would have been smarter and I think more pragmatic to just suck it up and vote for either Romney or Obama. I get it some people didnt like either of them but the idea that there really was any more than two options was just an illusion so it would have been better to vote for whichever you deemed the lesser of two evils and if you wish support your choice of third party candidate in other ways so that they perhaps have a better chance next election season.

Ill quote from him Morality and values depend on the existence of conscious minds and specifically on the fact that such minds can experience various forms of wellbeing and suffering in this universe. Conscious minds and their states are natural phenomena of course fully constrained by the laws of Nature whatever these turn out to be in the end. Therefore there must be right and wrong answers to questions of morality and values that potentially fall within the purview of science. On this view some people and cultures will be right to a greater or lesser degree and some will be wrong with respect to what they deem important in life.I guess ultimately this is a very utilitarian moral philosophy essentially replacing good with wellbeing. I think the concept of wellbeing is much easier to quantify and operationalise than good as good is much more vaguely defined than wellbeing which looks more at individuals than whole situations. He answers two initial criticism in his article here Id try to at least flick through the article before replying with an attempting at changing my view. I think he addresses the problems of measuring wellbeing pretty well in the article and what he calls the persuasion problem as well although if you think you can expand on the argument go ahead.Ive heard this fellow Sam wants to Nuke all Muslim countries or something I dont think that I just think that there is a better way to determine morality than scripture rubbish trying to figure out what god wants through observing nature Aristotle and all western religions as far as Im aware or just relying on tradition and cultural norms the only other alternative to science and logic I can think of.I guess pure nihilism is one position you could take although arguably this is something addressed by Harri in the section on the problem of persuasion plus I dont think anybody is really a nihilist when it comes to the crunch. Ive included this quote from the article incase you cant read through itIt seems to me that there are three distinct challenges put forward thus far. There is no scientific basis to say that we should value wellbeing our own or anyone elses. The Value Problem. Hence if someone does not care about wellbeing or cares only about his own and not about the wellbeing of others there is no way to argue that he is wrong from the point of view of science. The Persuasion Problem. Even if we did agree to grant wellbeing primacy in any discussion of morality it is difficult or impossible to define it with rigor. It is therefore impossible to measure wellbeing scientifically. Thus there can be no science of morality. The Measurement ProblemI believe all of these challenges are the product of philosophical confusion. The simplest way to see this is by analogy to medicine and the mysterious quantity we call health. Lets swap morality for medicine and wellbeing for health and see how things look. There is no scientific basis to say that we should value health our own or anyone elses. The Value Problem. Hence if someone does not care about health or cares only about his own and not about the health of others there is no way to argue that he is wrong from the point of view of science. The Persuasion Problem. Even if we did agree to grant health primacy in any discussion of medicine it is difficult or impossible to define it with rigor. It is therefore impossible to measure health scientifically. Thus there can be no science of medicine. The Measurement ProblemWhile the analogy may not be perfect I maintain that it is good enough to obviate these three criticisms. Is there a Value Problem with respect to health? Is it unscientific to value health and seek to maximize it within the context of medicine? No. Clearly there are scientific truths to be known about health and we can fail to know them to our great detriment. This is a fact. And yet it is possible for people to deny this fact or to have perverse and even selfdestructive ideas about how to live. Needless to say it can be fruitless to argue with such people. Does this mean we have a Persuasion Problem with respect to medicine? No. Christian Scientists homeopaths voodoo priests and the legions of the confused dont get to vote on the principles of medicine. Health is also hard to define and what is more the definition keeps changing. There is no clear metric by which we can measure it and there may never be one because health is a suitcase term for hundreds if not thousands of variables. Is an ability to jump very high one of them? That depends. What would my doctor think if I wanted a full neurological workup because I can only manage a inch vertical leap? He would think I had lost my mind. However if I were a professional basketball player who had enjoyed a inch leap every day of his adult life I would be reporting a sudden percent decline in my abilities not a good sign. Do such contingencies give us a Measurement Problem with respect to health? Do they indicate that medicine will never be a proper science? No. Health is a loose concept that may always bend and stretch depending on the context but there is no question that both it and its context exist within an underlying reality which we can understand or fail to understand with the tools of science. I think maybe the biggest flaw with the idea is that it could become a very authoritarian philosophy. I think thats the real area for discussion.'},\n {'id': 't3_249sxa',\n  'titles': 'Grammar Nazis are pointless and correcting peoples grammatical and spelling errors on the internet is pedantic',\n  'argument': 'The internet or at least Reddit is filled with grammar Nazis people who point out spelling and grammatical errors with a passion no matter how minute and insignificant.

Im going to give two objections to the argument from miracles one by Hume and one an updated version of Humes objection by J. L. Mackie given in his book The Miracle of Theism.Here is Humes objection to the argument from miracles as presented by J. L. Mackie this is my condensation of Mackies discussion of Hume and does not appear in this form in Mackies book.. We can determine whether or not to accept a given piece of testimony by considering two things the credibility of the witness and the intrinsic likelihood of the claim that the witness is making.. A law of nature is a maximally strong induction from past experience.. A miracle is a claim that contradicts a law of nature.. Therefore a miracle is a claim that contradicts a maximally strong induction from past experience. from and . But induction from past experience is the only means we have of evaluating the intrinsic likelihood of an event.. Therefore miracles have a very low intrinsic likelihood. from and . In practice the credibility of a witness will never be sufficiently high as to equal or outweigh such a low intrinsic likelihood. There are five reasons for thinking this a miracles are never testified to by sufficiently many people with spotless reputations excellent educations and a lot to lose in the event that they are caught lying b people have a tendency to like believing in strange things like miracles and UFOs c miracles usually come from backward nations d the miracles of different religions cancel each other out and e in religious communities credulity is thought to be a good thing so they encourage each other to believe more and more in the miracles of their religion.. Therefore in practice we should always reject miraculous claims. from and Mackie sums up Humes argument from a different perspective as follows If the unlikelihood of the testimonys being false is less than the intrinsic unlikelihood of the miracle then we must reject the miracle report with a confidence corresponding to the difference between the two. If the unlikelihood of the testimonys being false is equal to the intrinsic unlikelihood of the miracle then we must suspend judgment. If the unlikelihood of the testimonys being false is greater than the intrinsic unlikelihood of the miracle we must accept the miracle but only with the modest degree of confidence permitted by the difference between the two unlikelihoods.Mackie updates Humes argument as follows this is more of an inductive inference. To establish that a miracle occurred it is necessary to establish both that the event took place and that it violated the laws of nature.. Showing that an event violates the laws of nature is a strong reason to think that the event did not occur.. Showing that an event occurred is a strong reason to think that it did not violate the laws of nature.. Therefore the atheist will always be able to object to the argument from miracles by arguing either that the event must not have occurred or that the event must not have violated the laws of nature. Which one we use will depend on the specific alleged miracle under discussion if the miracle is not well supported then the former tactic is stronger and if the miracle is well supported then the latter tactic is stronger.. Therefore in practice the theist will never be able to establish that a miracle occurred.Mackie notes that this reasoning even applies to miracles which one has witnessed for oneself. The miracle that you have witness might not really have occurred since you might have misperceived something been tricked by a magician or deluded yourself about what you saw over a period of time. Alternatively the event you witness might have occurred in accordance with the laws of nature after all.To change my view about this you will have to show that Humes argument and Mackies argument both fail.'},\n {'id': 't3_245y6b',\n  'titles': 'The net neutrality debate is silly.',\n  'argument': 'Internet speeds are getting faster so quickly that the idea of anything being slower than another online will just not matter in five or ten yearsOur appetite for data grows as well but it seems to me like internet speed will outstrip it quite soon.

It would make scheduling easier business meetings would be smoother and thered be much less confusion when travelling and trying to synchronise things between countries. It wouldnt make any difference to sleep cycles or work hours or anything like that. We would also abolish daylight saving time.What Im not suggesting is that the world all wake up at the same time and go to work at the same time. Lets say that we agree on GMT as the worlds timezone although it doesnt matter which time we choose. London would wake up at about am work from am pm and go to sleep at about pm. The sun would rise at about am and would set at about pm. New York however are hours behind London so the sun would rise there at am on the universal clock. This doesnt affect anything though because theyd wake up at am go to work from am pm and go to bed at pm. Theyd still get up when the sun rises and go to bed when the sun sets but the only difference would be the number they read off the clock. Theyd still have the same sleeping pattern and working hours and theyd get used to it in a matter of weeks. Instead of waking up and reading the time as am theyd wake up at the same time and read the clock as am. All that would change is what time they consider nighttime. Sydney meanwhile are hours in front of London they wake up when the sun rises at pm they work from pm am see the sun set at am and go to sleep at am. It seems weird that they should go to sleep at am but to them it would be the correct time! Theyd still be going to sleep shortly after sunset like the rest of the world and would go to sleep right on schedule at the same time they would now. Theyd just call the time they go to bed am rather than pm. The only difference is the time they read off the clockThe times used above are obviously an arbitrary template used to demonstrate my argument. This would synchronise the world so if you want to skype your friend in Sydney from London you can just say Ill call you at am and hell know exactly when to expect your call. The same goes for business meetings etc. Scheduling in general becomes so much easier. It doesnt solve problems like jet lag because when you travel you still have to adapt to the physical difference in location on the planet. It also makes programming a hell of a lot easier because timezones are a nightmare to program properly It can also make contracts easier because if any one person says that something should start at exactly am nobody disagrees about what time that is and theres so much less confusion.I think its a good idea but Ive never met anyone who agrees with me but Ive also never met anyone whos presented a convincing counterargument.

Firstly by spreading goodwill I mean a huge official initiative to help out other countries a larger scale of aid to improve the quality of life.

Granted older consoles used chips often found in PCs the NESs CPU was based off the design of the one used in the Apple II and C Genesis used the Zilog Z And Motorola K ect. but they produced results that greatly differed from one another in terms of processing sound and graphics. But with this current gen both the Xbox One and PS use the same microarchitecture x in their APUs that are manufactured by the same company AMD that is used in current PCs today. Many of both consoles nonexclusives have also been shown to underperform graphically when pitted against desktops made for the same price as them.The other point that I feel no longer separates consoles and PCs is their firmware and the need to constantly update it as well as patch games via internet. Again with older consoles if I put a functioning copy of Super Metroid in any working SNES it should play immediately and thats it. I can understand with the th Generations addition with a UI to adjust the clock manage saves and other basic functions but when there were additions like internet browsers multimedia players Streaming Video and other services that added nothing to ones gameplay experiences it seemed like a waste of resources and redundant when my computer can do the same things.And on the subject of online patches Id like to give another example concerning cartridgebased games. Sure there were rereleases of patched games like Final Fantasy fixing a bug with a characters common skill or one of the Shinobi games taking out the blatant copyright infringing characters or Ocarina of Times removal of bugs and Islamic references. But most times the game you bought was the game you got. Now we have to add storage devices to hold all the revisions of Skyrim Borderlands and Halo a similar issue PC users have to deal with.Another small point is that of maintenance. Ignoring that older consoles last longer due to simpler internals and arguably more durable designs s are imfamous for their Red Ring of Death errors.

In this thread Ill defend the tenability of a position on the mindbody problem called dualism. I would like the main emphasis in this thread to be on the debate between dualism and materialism although other theories of mind like panpsychism are welcome as well.Dualism is the position that the mind is immaterial. There are two main kinds of dualism. Substance dualism This is the position that the mind is an immaterial thing distinct from the brain. This position is defended primarily by religious philosophers and has generally fallen out of favor in contemporary philosophy. Descartes is the philosopher most associated with this position but it has modern defenders like Richard Swinburne.. Property dualism This is the position that the mind is an immaterial property of the brain. This position is much more popular than substance dualism and is defended by secular philosophers like David Chalmers. I think property dualism is more tenable than substance dualism.The most widely held competitor to dualism is materialism which holds that the mind is material. There are a number of forms of materialism as well ranging from the unsophisticated identity theory mental states are identical to physical processes in the brain to the more fashionable functionalism mental states are identical to the functional roles of brain states in the system of brain states. Perhaps the most prominent defender of functionalism is Daniel Dennett.I think that dualism is a tenable position in philosophy of mind in other words there is nothing obviously irrational about it there are arguments for it that dont make any clear blunders and a reasonable person could arrive at this conclusion. This is a very modest claim that I suspect even most materialist philosophers would accept.I think there are two arguments that make it reasonable to be a dualist.My first argument for dualism is that we have qualia. Qualia are subjective private first person experiences they are what it is like to be in a certain state. If I look at a white wall in my room there are photons registering in my eyes and chemical events going on in my brain but there is also something it is like to be looking at the white wall a white quale.It is difficult to see how the qualia in my example could be identical to the chemical events going on in my brain because we can always ask why any given chemical process is accompanied by qualia. To give another example stimulation of the Cfibers is always accompanied by pain qualia but it seems reasonable enough to ask why stimulation of the Cfibers has to be accompanied by qualia. I do not mean to imply that these questions have no answers. I am just saying that the fact that it is reasonable to ask them suggests that qualia are not literally identical to any physical event.Chalmers brings this point out by means of his zombie thought experiment in his book The Conscious Mind. We can conceive of a world exactly like ours in every physical respect but in which no one has any conscious experience i.e. any qualia. Since we can conceive of a zombie world it must be possible and if it is possible then qualia are not identical to physical processes.Chalmers uses other thought experiments in his book as well. For example we can conceive of someone who had exactly the same physical makeup as we do having inverted qualia where we have a red quale they have a green quale etc.. This suggests again that qualia are not identical to physical events.My second argument for dualism is that the mind has properties that a physical process cannot have and physical processes have properties that the mind cannot have. A thought can be apt or witty but a chemical process cannot. Again a physical process can have a temperature or velocity but a thought cannot. This suggests strongly that the mind is not a physical process.So I think its clear that dualism is a tenable position that a reasonable person could hold. I dont claim to know that it is true but it deserves more respect than it often gets on Reddit and elsewhere on the internet. To change my view about this you will have to satisfactorily refute my arguments not just brush them off as materialists are wont to do.'},\n {'id': 't3_23litg',\n  'titles': 'Smart phones and modern social media like Facebook are ruining human relationships.',\n  'argument': 'We live in a world now that is monopolized by websites like Facebook Twitter Instagram etc. These technologies in addition to the advent of smartphones have changed the way we interact with one another for the worse.

I guess the ancient stuff is probably bullshit too but Id like to keep this to the modern yoga topic. There isnt much clinical evidence to support yogas supposed benefits. Most of the clinical information so far has been short term studies with small sample sizes. And they dont compare it to other physical exercises like running swimming lifting weights etc. which are more beneficial. So sure yoga may be better than doing nothing but it doesnt appear to be better than other forms of physical exercise. Yoga isnt a cure all like its touted to be serious medical conditions can result from doing yoga and theres no evidence to suggest that itll ward off cancer or other serious ailments. Yet its touted to help your body energy and other bullshit. Its built on pseudoscience. Third eye chakras whateverelse its all a bunch of bullshit that isnt found in any area of science. This article sums it up quite nicely.Im a bodybuilderweightlifter so I tend to enjoy trying out different forms of exercise in order to see if I can gain a competitive advantage. Most of yogas moves for me seem like bullshit because they place artificial strain on the bodies muscles and joints akin to hyperextending which of course is difficult but thats only because our bodies arent designed to bend that way. I would consider myself quite flexible but some yoga poses seem downright scamworthy due to the way that the strain is applied to your body. Its like a chiropractor who cracks your back and tells you how much tension you have which doesnt really do anything since it just requires you to continue to seem them.Its the same with yoga after a session you feel good for a little while but then it wears off and you end up feeling worse if you dont go back again. Placing unnatural and unnecessary strain on the body may make you feel like you have a lot to work on but in reality its because your body isnt designed to bend that way and would probably benefit just as much from cardiovascular exercise and light stretching.I think it delves further into scam territory due to it being so consumerist. The cheapest membership I found was about month and they can go way up from there including weekend retreats that can cost several thousand dollars. You can find a gym membership for month.

Loud voices have emerged from that debate stating that people should be allowed to believe whatever they want as long as it does not directly harm anyone.Its my view that this position is incorrect for a number of reasons and more harmful than the alternatives. There may in fact be more of a net benefit for peoples spirituality from education about our reality than by defending their right to stay wrong. Again my issue is not with the people who hold the outdated views. The reality is that most adult humans reach adulthood already holding strong views and wont switch away from them in most circumstances. If they have taken the time to debate with others and look at information regarding their world and tried to come to a rational conclusion yet decide to still hold on to outdated views there is not much that any human can do. Defending their right to stay wrong is definitely not a good course of action as it directly promotes that correctness is not important or valuable in our society. This has far reaching implications in how our surroundings think especially in how these hardheaded adults bring their children up.If someone actively chooses to be incorrect in regards to how they see the world the best thing we can do is try to educate them. The middle ground is ignoring them completely hope their children use the Internet and seek out knowledge and that they arent making decisions based on their worldview. The worst case scenario is defending their right to believe whatever they want. Lets take an example Bob believes that God is real. He cant really define what God is but thinking that someone is always watching him feels good. Rebecca tries to explain to him the history of religion and how the belief in God came from not understanding nature and humans requiring a catchall to explain things. She explains to him that we now know what the stars are and that we are actually star material. She explains that praying feels good because introspection is important and how although there is no thing watching over him the beauty of life itself is way cooler anyways.Bob thinks about it and decides that although those arguments might make scientific sense they dont make him any happier. Accepting ones place in the cosmos takes too much humility and instead of working on that Bob takes the intellectually lazy approach and just stays with good olde God. The next best outcome is not Rebecca defending his right to hold incorrect views about the world. Its Rebecca not saying anything. If someone defends that were allowed to believe whatever we want all it does is promote intellectual laziness and potentially encourages actually harmful views to materialize and propagate.'},\n {'id': 't3_238wk7',\n  'titles': 'I think the Republicans have repugnant social views but it doesnt matter because none of them will be enacted',\n  'argument': 'Im prochoice in all cases but its pretty much a fact that Roe v.

Often that employees workload spills over onto his or her coworkers. There are plenty of people who have children who have other arrangements in place and are able to work their full shifts so clearly there must be some kind of acceptable mechanism in place and theres no reason all working parents cant use it. The excuse that one needs to leave early to save on childcare expenses is not valid. Childcare expenses are simply a reality for working parents and its part of the deal that you accepted when you chose to reproduce. Note that my argument here is only when this happens on a regular basis. I dont have a problem with parents using accrued leave in order to leave early for specific events or emergency situations just like any childless employee would be able to do as well. The problem is with parents being allowed to leave early especially in salary situations where their pay does not decrease by working fewer hours and childless coworkers being expected to pick up the slack. Parents are always not it when someone has to work a holiday.In the case of operations childless employees are much more likely to get stuck working holidays. Just because an employee is childless doesnt make their holiday plans any less important they also have families and events that are important to them. These kinds of work assignments should be rotated fairly regardless of an employees parental status. Bringing your child to work as an alternative to childcare is not okay.Im not talking about once or twice a year for Bring your kid to work day or to trickortreat at Halloween Im talking about bringing your kid to work and having them camp out in your workspace for hours at a time. Their presence is distracting. Again paying for childcare is part of the burden you accepted when you chose to become a working parent. Also your kids are tiny friggin germ factories and your coworkers wont appreciate catching the cold thats going around Mrs. Thompsons nd grade class. Childless employees are not selfish for demanding equal treatment.I would instead argue that the offending parents are selfish for expecting to be treated like special snowflakes because they have a child or children.Being a childless person and having had to put up with entitled parents considering me to be less of a person than they simply because I havent popped out a baby I realize that my view here will be difficult to change but I would like to have more information so I can form a more wellrounded opinion.

Ninja Edit I was raised in a not particularly diverse part of America and a decent chunk of my school career was spent in classes or watching presentations or badly acted videos about how judging people based on their skin color was wrong and that labeling people based on their skin color was wrong etc. I and my white classmates and my white teachers were all pretty much on the same page about the nword being bad and mean. Now as Im getting older and finding myself really enjoying hip hop in general Im discovering that a to me surprising portion of the population seems to think theyve taken the word back and made it their own. Which would be great if it were true because then a group of people would have been able to take a label of disempowerment and remove the hate from it appropriate it into something positive and wear it as a badge of honor and solidarity. And if you glanced at hip hop music out of context you might even think they succeeded.In that context it draws similarities to the word nerd and geek where the people labeled that way decided that what made them that way was something to be proud of not ashamed. Obviously when youre talking about hobbies vs. race its not a perfect example and Im by no means trying to trivialize the oppression that did happen. Im no stranger to the historical context of the word and why any time it comes out of a white persons mouth it seems justifiable to be suspect of his or her intentions but it seems to me that if the word had actually been taken back then anyone should be able to use it in its properly reformed context regardless of their skin color.I mean a desk is a desk no matter who says desk.And while the people I can call friends might be different from the people you can call friends it doesnt suddenly change its meaning let alone become a slur of derision when someone else says it.So why for a very specific group of Americans is my nigga a compliment and coming from quite literally anyone else in any other context besides academia a racial slur?I feel like cultural appropriation is tied into this topic too but I cant really articulate how.TLDR If Childish Gambino Jay Z Lil Wayne and Kanye West can use nigga positively why cant Eminem if his intentions are good and the context is positive?

Further though my knowledge of genetics is admittedly limited I believe the scientific consensus is that genetics nature tend to have more bearing on individual behavior than social context or upbringing nurture.

I like very much the idea that we wouldnt need a government and that we could make communal decisions in a way that wouldnt involve coercion of anyone or from anyone.

Maybe theyre jerks maybe they did something really great set up irrigation maintained a road and feel that theyve earned this percentage. Either way that sounds like taxation which is a function of government. This group would be taking from the populace against their will but theyd have enough people to do so by force. How do you prevent this from happening as I think its reasonable that it might?The only solution I can think of would be to form another larger coalition comprised those being stolen from Coalition B and present a greater show of force to prevent the theft. But isnt that just the recreation of a government? It might be a minimal one or one that we agree is fair but a state nonetheless? Its activity was definitely coercive and their prevention of theft was against Coalition As will for sure which is a kind of cardinal sin for an Anarchist as I understand it. How to you reconcile this situation? Regardless of how you define Coalition A a small government or just thieves they present a problem to the rest of the anarchists. Theres no reason to think that any individual anarchist would be able to put a stop to Coalition A. And the formation of Coalition B looks a lot like a government Anarchism seems to seek to prevent or eliminate.

Without access to nutritious food an individual is at an immediate disadvantage their brain development and physical health will be stunted which serves to limit the rewards that hard work is capable of accomplishing. Also in large part because of the lack of affordability of nutritious food people in America who live in the most povertydense counties are those most prone to obesity which can cause a variety of diseases and other medical problems which all take energy and other resources away from attempts to be successful. Unevenly distributed educational opportunities also prevent the same amount of energy from producing the same rewards. Every field requires knowledge that we are not born with. Education ought to maintain a balance between unlocking each individuals unique passion challenging them with thoughts from other fields which can provide ammunition for the synthesis necessary to be innovative and successful in their main field and installing the basic literacy in a variety of subjects that is necessary for constructive participation in society. Given that the alternative to universal healthcare seems to be a choice for some between blowing their savings to get treatment and simply living untreated both the medical problems which are systemic like those caused by obesity and the medical problems which are the product of random chance are going to more significantly impact people born into poverty limiting their ability to see the same rewards for the same amount of effort.'},\n {'id': 't3_22akzj',\n  'titles': 'I dont believe fast foods or WalMart type jobs should pay more than minimum wage.',\n  'argument': 'They are jobs even the mentally handicap can do.

In my view these are all part and parcel of what needs to occur to acheive a functional and fair society under an eventual Minarchist Libertarian style of government. For the purpose of this discussion I assume that these elements are all necessary and must be implemented together.

I have no clear idea of how or even if this wouldcould work so I bring it to you all for critique. Some will boggle at the idea that a selfdescribed Libertarian could even suggest such a thing and I admit this seems contradictory. However IMHO endorsing a particular set of rules necessitates knowing when it is appropriate to break the rules as a means of making the rules work properly. Address this point in comments if you have further issues with my opinion.Below are many questions in need of good answers. Feel free to add your own.When that is answered the solution will be fairly easy to come to.Redistribution Should we enact a onetime massredistribution of wealth? Moral proscons. How might a onetime massredistribution of wealth be enacted? Gradually? All at once? Through taxes or direct confiscation? How much should be taken from the ? What is the reasonable limit on such an action? How far down the scale of personal wealth is it proper to go? Should this include all property or only cash? What about those whose wealth is primarily tied up in investmentsstocks? Would it be most appropriate to divest sole business owners of amassed wealth by specifically dividing ownershipprofits of that business to the current employees as opposed to dividing it out to the general public? Would it also be necessary to enact caps on how much private property a person may be allowed to hold in terms of land ownershipcontrol? What are the likely intended results and unintended consequences of a onetime massredistribution of wealth?Basic Income Should we enact a Basic Income? Moral proscons. How would BI be funded and implemented? Where would the money come from and how would it be collected? How much BI is enough to allow people to live simply while still rewarding work for the extras? Should it be a single set amount of cash? A of GDP? What other metric might be better? Is it necessary to eliminate all other social safety net programs and convert them all to a single lumpsum under a Basic Income program? What are the likely intended results and unintended consequences of instituting a Basic Income?Outlaw RentingImagine a family renting a home and never owning it. Their payments never stop. They cant save for retirement or afford to send kids to college. All that money they spend on shelter just evaporates goes to the landlord. With rent abolished they start making mortgage payments and after years they stop paying. Now they can save and send their kids to college and help their kids buy homes. Their children have children and sell the original family home allowing the grandparents to pass on the value they invested to their grandkids so the grandkids can buy homes and send their kids to college. Now imagine everyone doing this. No one gets obscenely wealthy and no one is able to draw merely passive income but everyone has a home and land within their family. Within three generations we can solve a great many economic and social problems all by eliminating rent. Our society must stop feeding off itself by chasing some elusive and immoral dream of passive income through control of property. Should we outlaw Renting? Moral proscons. Is the sacrifice of this element of Personal Freedom to Rent your own Property worth it in the face of the benefit to society by establishing more stable and invested Ownership across a larger swath of the populace? What are the likely intended results and unintended consequences of a prohibition on Renting?I see that the current situation isnt great for anyone involved. I dont understand how people are even able to pay their rent... Most of the rent people pay us goes toward our mortgages the rest goes into repairs. All we do is shuffle money around. We dont realy add any value to the system and I hate it... If you want to change things look at laws concerning home building. Eliminate restrictions... superfluous requirements and youll see cheap housing start to appear. Youll put my family business out of business but everyone will be better off including me. Ill get a basic income too.Minarchist Libertarian GovernmentFor the purposes of this discussion I will give the Wikipedia definitionMinarchism also known as minimal statism is a political philosophy. It is variously defined by sources. In the strictest sense it holds that states ought to exist as opposed to anarchy that their only legitimate function is the protection of individuals from aggression theft breach of contract and fraud and that the only legitimate governmental institutions are the military police and courts. In the broadest sense it also includes fire departments prisons the executive and legislatures as legitimate government functions. Such states are generally called nightwatchman states.Minarchists argue that the state has no authority to use its monopoly of force to interfere with free transactions between people and see the states sole responsibility as ensuring that contracts between private individuals and property are protected through a system of law courts and enforcement. Minarchists generally believe a laissezfaire approach to the economy is most likely to lead to economic prosperity.This would mean that some bare minimum of appropriate taxes would still need to be collected to fund the minimum level of government necessary to ensure the above mentioned services along with a Basic Income. I consider this a necessary evil. This also means that the courts would no longer enforce or hold legitimate any Rental agreements just as one could not sell themselves into voluntary slavery.I know this is a HUGE post with a lot of assertions but I hope to get some great responses based on the voluminous fodder for discussion.

It is very hard for me to reconcile these arguments because in my opinion atheism is based on the exact same thing faith and belief.Dont get me wrong as a scientist I have studied extensively and I know that evolution is the mechanism by which life has diversified on earth the big bang etc. I also do not think that science in any way precludes the possible existence of a higher power.Simply put there is currently no way to prove or disprove the existence of deities and to me both theists and atheists are different sides of the same coin.Ask questions if I have not explained anything clearly enough. And again I am not here to belittle or to insult anyones views just an interesting that I think about a lot.Thanks yall. Also I will be replying as fast as I can.

Maybe I used ineffective search terms. Whatever.I was raised evangelical Christian Southern Baptist specifically. All through my life I held Christian viewpoints. I still do but I am discovering that a lot of the Southern Baptist doctrines are little more than traditions established over the years and have little to no Biblical basis or else are based on misinterpretations of scripture.Recently Ive been more and more often pulled into the conflict between the church and gay rights. Now Ive already made my position clear on gay rights People shouldnt be discriminated against for their sexual orientation regardless of how we feel as a religion about their actions its between two consenting adults and we dont have a right to legislate that and as Christians we should treat them with love.Furthermore as a heterosexual male married to a heterosexual female I have no personal stake in this. However Im finding it difficult to reconcile some parts of my worldview with the idea that homosexuality is morally wrong from Gods perspective. I have heard some fairly solid arguments each way. In short I am on the fence and thats not where I like to be. I am aware of the following points regarding homosexuality Something being natural or unnatural does not have any bearing upon its morality. Homosexuality is overtly condemned in the Old Testament law... along with a lot of other things that modern Christians do not follow due to Christs example and the release of many of the prohibitions upon Christian gentiles. So OT condemnations dont have any weight unless they come with a convincing argument that the lifting of the limitations doesnt apply to that particular part. There are parts of the New Testament that condemn homosexuality as well.So from the perspective of a Christian Change My View. Either convince me scripturally that homosexuality is wrong or that it is not condemned. But keep it within the scope of Christian values please. Im not asking whether its right or wrong. Im asking whether its scripturally defensible.My real question then is is homosexuality sin at all? Does God look down on it? Is it harmful to us the same way other sin is? Does it displease the Creator?Bonus points Is there any defense for homosexuality being okay with God that doesnt abolish the institution of monogamy or cause promiscuity to be okay?'},\n {'id': 't3_226qii',\n  'titles': 'We should all wear cameras in our heads that record everything we do.

I do not believe any successful politician has a continued interest in bettering the country in any meaningful way. I think that politicians are driven by money from their investors and their salaries. I think government is pretty much a joke of beurocracy where nothing gets properly discussed or worked out because everyone is too busy measuring their dicks. I feel like voting is a waste of time. I have little to no concept of what the differences are between Labour and Conservative any more. Politicians are forced to make promises they cant keep during their election campaigns making thought processes like Ill vote lib dem because they wont raise tuition fees pointless and it makes fools of us all. In real world terms Ill continue to vote because I suppose we should atleast attempt to keep parties like the BNP out of power. But really I think the whole thing is a farce designed to just about give us the impression that we have some say so there isnt a total uprising without actually giving the people any power. I guess my two main points are . Voting gives the impression of empowering the population without giving them any power. . The main parties are basically the same in as much as pretty much the same things will happen no matter who is in power. Due to corruptionbeurocracy etc Change my view!

I cant deny that I have some internal eyerolling when I see the term thrown around though. It seems to me that identifying as genderfluid stems from a failure to separate gender identity from gender roles. For example someone is malebodied and doesnt experience dysphoria but they play with dolls or like the color pink. This doesnt mean that theyre some sort of boygirl mix it just means theyre a boy who likes dolls. To suggest that men cant perform female gender roles without becoming part girl seems like s type of thinking. When they play with trucks the next day they havent turned back into a man theyre just a guy who likes dolls and trucks.Now as to why I think this is an issue for trans people. One of the major struggles the trans community faces is getting people to understand that they were born in the wrong body. It isnt an act theyre putting on and it isnt a choice they made. When a genderfluid person comes in and says Im feeling a little feminine I guess Im a woman today. it gives ammunition to the opposition. Finally Ill admit some ignorance here because I dont personally know anyone who identifies as genderfluidgenderqueer. Do genderfluid people experience dysphoria when their genderoftheday doesnt match their physical sex?

When I was little a friends dad once told me If you fight someone way smaller than you dont expect them to fight clean. I have always thought terrorism is just this same phenomenon on a national scale. Think about it. If some powerful country is carrying out abusive foreign policy in your country and its military is incomparably superior to yours are you going to fight a conventional war against them ? Of course not !If you abuse people they will fight back in whatever way they can. Since you leave no opportunity for a fair fight you are essentially asking for a clandestine dirty war. After Vietnam who would be stupid enough to take on the US face to face?Now I am not in any way justifying what terrorists have done but we also have to recognize the fact that we US amp Other Western Countries have committed terrible abuses throughout the world. And also that we are spending ridiculous amounts of money improving our armies to fight wars against enemies that dont exist and will likely never exist.There might be a good argument against this which is that terrorists arent actually killing the armed forces of the countries they attack but rather civilians. This is true but I think if these countries had the ability to fight back in a conventional war with comparable armies the antiUS sentiment could be channeled through their hypothetical armies and not through terrorist acts.

Im skeptical of the value of the right to bear arms and though Im not necessarily against it I do believe disarmament is ideal. I wont get into the political ramifications of the gun debate here in America I just want to focus on one aspect of it that we requires guns specifically conceal carry guns for selfdefense.Ive studied selfdefense arts like krav maga for a bit now and everything Ive learned about guns tells me they are terrible for this purpose. First of all the foot rule teaches us that a man with a knife will almost always win against a man with a holstered gun. Holstered is the only reasonable scenario for what Im talking about here. I assume youre not going to be walking past every dark alley or through every crowded bar with your weapon drawn. When do you get a chance to see a mugger or home invader coming from feet away? And if youre defending yourself in a crowded bar your bullets can only add to the danger of everyone around you even if youre skilled. All of this assumes you have decent training and are physically and mentally unimpaired. Worldclass police officers with years of experience adhere rigidly to the foot rule. Amateur concealcarriers are going to fair even worse Id imagine.I agree that guns are a tool like any other that can be used and misused. I also believe guns are a completely inefficient tool for anything other than combat with intent to kill and the idea that we need to guns to stop muggers and rapists is a fallacy we use to excuse our love affair with weaponry.Obviously we can craft scenarios where a gun is the best possible tool for self defense but thats just my point these scenarios are almost always completely unrealistic. Far more efficient options include good aggressive unarmed self defense techniques conflict avoidance investing in home security that prevents home invaders from actually entering the building and options like tasers which can still be misused but are less likely to cause loss of life.Certainly we cant eliminate risk. There will always be failures and tragedies guns or no guns. But guns make wholesale slaughter a lot easier because thats what theyre designed for and the rebranding of weaponry as a viable selfdefense tool is just irresponsible. I dont hate guns or people who own them but I think people think guns will protect them and I think thats a lie.To change my view Id like proof that guns are a viable self defense tool. Statistic are often unreliable on this topic due to the highly political nature of the argument but Ill accept any strong logical arguments.I still maintain two beliefs one that people massively overvalue guns as self defense tools such that they neglect other forms of training. Selfdefense requires a well rounded regimen putting all of your faith in one tool is lazy and oftentimes dangerous. And two that we as a culture all suffer from the misinformation surrounding guns. The fact that guns might be useful as a crime deterrent does not mean we shouldnt be extremely skeptical of the people who shill them or the culture they create.But overall I think my original V is Cd. By all means keep the discussion going. Ill be checking back in to see if anyone else has raised some good points.'},\n ...]"
